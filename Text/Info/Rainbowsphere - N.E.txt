Some people have been hacking the scorelist, just for you all to know:
Everything above 150.000 is imposible to get

We heard some complaints that the original was too hard.

So here is a n00b edition, its easier, a bit shorter, and has its own highscore list. People should now be able to finish the game easier.

Once you played this, you can play the full game. Which is much harder and longer.
