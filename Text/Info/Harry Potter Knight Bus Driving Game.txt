Just like the Harry Potter movie, the Knight Bus picks up stranded wizards and drops them off at their destinations. In this game, you get the chance to steer the purple triple-decker Knight Bus around the streets of London. You start with 30 seconds to pick up your first passenger. Once you pick up a passenger, the game then specifies an amount of time that you have to take them to their destination. If you reach the destination before the alloted time, you get to keep the extra time for future passengers. However, if you run out of time, the game will end. Be careful not to drive into buildings. If you do, you will accumulate damage points. If the damage meter reaches 100%, the game will end.
