Epilepsy Warning: despite the fact that this game likely won�t trigger an epileptic attack (as several epileptics have mentioned to me), I�m putting this warning up just to calm people down in the comments ;)

This was just a quick design exercise that I made in a day and a half. I wanted to teach the player a couple simple to learn mechanics and then throw them into some extremely distilled metroidvanias.

I�m posting it here just to see what people think, so let me know!
