But, for now. Here's Bunnykill 5 part 1 in all of it's glory. I hope you like it. Also, I need to
      mention something. Some people seem to be confused about the storyline. So here's the deal. The story in
      the
      Bunnykill movies is not connected in any way whatsoever. Even though the characters(or their appearance, to be
      more precise) is the same, the story is always different. Kinda like in the Legend Of Zelda. I hope that
      clears
      the confusion as to why some dead characters are back and whatnot.
