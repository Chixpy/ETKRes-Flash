How to play Car Ferry

In this tricky physics game you need to get the car onto the ferry. There’s just one problem: there’s no bridge! Use the available materials to create a makeshift bridge that will stay afloat long enough for the car to board. Click to drop objects. As soon as you’ve created a bridge, click the car to make it drive across. Collect as many stars as you can for extra points!
