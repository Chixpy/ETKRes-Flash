We have never believed in prophecy and the powers of evil caught us flatfooted again. Gatma has already tried to destroy our world once, though a brave wizard Induky sacrificed himself and confined the evil in his grave. Gatma and his lap-dogs broke into our dimension again, willing to plunge our world into chaos and darkness. Only you can stop them. Hurry up, no time to lose, the demons get stronger and stronger day by day! With every new day demons become stronger.
