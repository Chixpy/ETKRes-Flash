Can you get the power up and running again? Glow Path is a great connect the lines (plumber) pipeline game. Each fun puzzle consists of a grid with different pieces of wire on it. Making a path from the colored box to the grey box is the key! As you link up the pieces of wire from the colored box the power will run through the wires and they will begin to glow.
