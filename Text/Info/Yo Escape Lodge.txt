You took your snowboard to the top of the snow covered mountain. While shredding some major drifts, you ran into a tree and rolled into a giant snowball down the mountain. That is the last thing you remember, now you are locked in a room of the lodge. There must be a way to escape and you are going to find it! Good luck and have fun playing!
