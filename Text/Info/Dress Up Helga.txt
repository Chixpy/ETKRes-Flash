Been a loonnngg time since I done anything with flash. Almost 5 years. And what better way to warm up than to practice? Didn't take very long and it's very basic but I might plan to do more in future. Possibly maybe a Dress up Arnold?

Based her outfits off many episodes worth of browsing. I added a few of my own items. I personally like the ruby shades.

Pretty satisfied with the result regardless. Hope it's as fun for you as it was for me.

If you want to help save the second Hey Arnold movie, please join [link]. It's a very friendly group with lots of interactivity. We can do it!
