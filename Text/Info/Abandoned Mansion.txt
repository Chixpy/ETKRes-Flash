While relaxing in the local pub you overheard a few gentlemen talking about an abandoned Mansion that was supposed to have some treasure hidden inside. You decided to go and check it out. Once you arrive you start having second thoughts about going inside. Too bad the taxi left and now you are stranded at the abandoned mansion. You might as well go inside and check it out....
