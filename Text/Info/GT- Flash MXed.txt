Thanks for all the advice with the beta version. I have tryed to fullfill all suggestions and ideas. The game does lack sound however. This is due to the slow down it caused the game. So sorry but no sound for now. I am now working on a VERSION 2 to the game. With a new city and a car jacking feature. Look out for it and check (http://twod.co.uk) for updates.

Enjoy...
