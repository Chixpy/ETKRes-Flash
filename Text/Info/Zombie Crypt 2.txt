Zombie Crypt is back, and better than ever!
Test your platform skills in this bloody puzzle platformer, and find out if you can clear all 16 stages. The game also contains 20 medals for your pleasure.
In the last game there seemed to be some confusing about whether the game should be played by either 1 or 2 players. Well… The game is meant to be played by just 1 player to add an extra dimension of difficulty. However you’re obviously free to play the game with players.
