This was a project I decided to do with the foil wrappers from easter candies, as well as something I had
      just wanted to do with simple character design. You can go back to the beginning from any point if you get
      confused or want to watch a part over again, to do so click anywhere. This was a really great one for me, I
      felt
      that with previous submissions I had more wanted to fill the time than anything, so with this one I didn't
      worry about that, and I focused more on the little details that make it look as nice as it can. The ideas
      behind
      it are highly..interpretive, so make of them what you will, and then let me know what you think if you decide
      to
      review! In my opinion, its a merging of two stories, the first of a schizophrenic, and the second of a curious
      robot set to use his grey club on the beauties that may appear, as well as the darker half of the
      schizophrenic
      person. 1541 frames, 64.2 seconds, running at 24 fps. Hope you enjoy it!
