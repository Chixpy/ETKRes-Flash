Roll and Jump is a skill game where the goal is to climb as high as possible by jumping from a rolling circle to another.

Climb and do the highest score as possible.
You can do a wall jump, a double jump or activate slow motion!

Easy to learn, but hard to master!

4 successive circles (4 combo) = +1 point multiplicator
If you touch a wall or a yellow circle you lose 1 point multiplicator.
However the slow motion costs 1 combo.
