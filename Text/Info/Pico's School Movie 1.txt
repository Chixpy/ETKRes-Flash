hey, im back with my second submission.. a remake of pico's school as a movie! YAY!

im sorry i couldnt finish the entire movie... the deadline was too tight and it was my first serious flash... next year i'll have the second and third parts done...

i got the sounds from flash kit and made some myself... music is from hive and chunks from another song :O
almost 2000 frames... alot of FBF and action, synced with neat music.

hope you like it!
