This one-room demo was constructed from scratch (including non-character art production) in about an hour. There's not a lot to do within the demo, but it illustrates several key features of the Lassie engine in action, including: floating layers (walk in front/behind the palm tree), inventory, room scrolling, and grid-based scale/color filtering. The character sprite is not fully animated, so the avatar will sometimes move without his legs animating.
