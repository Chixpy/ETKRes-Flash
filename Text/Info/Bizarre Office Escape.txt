The 534th escape game from 123bee.com. Late hours, I was engrossed in my work. Suddenly I heard a loud noise. When I went out to check-in, I realized the office boy had locked the door without noticing me. Already it is late and I have to get out as soon as possible. Can you help me to come out from the office by finding clues and correlate them logically to escape from this place?
