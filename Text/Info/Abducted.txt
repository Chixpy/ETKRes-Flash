You were walking home late at night and decided to go down a dark alley. Out of nowhere, a tough guy jumps out saying that his boss is looking for you. You try to explain that he has the wrong guy but it's too late. He knocks you out and takes you to an abandoned place. He says if you want to leave, you will find him the treasure you hid. Good luck and have fun playing!
