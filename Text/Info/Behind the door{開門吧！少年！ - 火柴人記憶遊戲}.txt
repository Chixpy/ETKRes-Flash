â– How to play:

Memorize the corrent door from each level, and reverse the answer.
You will get prize if you win the level, but you will get something bad if you answer wrong! ;D
You can use ultimate skill to show all answers, at the upper left corner.
How many level you can survive?

Hi! I'm Jeremy7986, a game developer who came from Taiwan.
I love stickman animation. Until now I'm still doing stickman animation and games.
This game "Behind the door" is the first game I made with English version.
And I add some classic and new MEME in this game, maybe you can recognize them!
Hope you enjoy it!
