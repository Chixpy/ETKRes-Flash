Original Description: Leave your worries behind by flying as far out of the city as you can to chill out and think. Hit the space bar to choose your angle and power for take off. Take your copter further by flying over the fuel cans. Give yourself a thermal blast skyward by piloting your way into the arrows. Good luck!
