Flash game developed for the British Liver Trust. The game was developed to highlight the risks of liver disease and raise awareness of liver cancer. The game levels introduce the risks of alcohol, fatty foods, the hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. Hats off to those who manage to battle through to level five where all the risks of liver disease have to be avoided to protect the liver.
