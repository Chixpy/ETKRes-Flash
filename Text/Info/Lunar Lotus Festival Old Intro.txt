The orginal link to the version with music gives a 404.
Scrapped intro for my dating sim. Started to dislike the song before I got finished with it so I ended up not completing it. Did this about a year ago but added a few misc files in it today to fill up blank space.

I'll link to the version with music added whenever I getSheezyart to act right.
