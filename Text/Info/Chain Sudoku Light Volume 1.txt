Each puzzle consists of a group of circles arranged in a square grid and containing given clues in various places. The object is to fill all empty circles so that the numbers 1 to 5 for 5×5 puzzles and 1 to 6 for 6×6 puzzles appear exactly once in each row, column and chain. There is only one unique solution for each puzzle.
