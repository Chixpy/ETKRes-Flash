This game is unfinished. As such, some features like saving and loading games do not function properly. The game does not autosave and instead needs to be saved manually by going to Save Game in the pause menu (by pressing ESC). Starting a new game while one is in progress gives unpredictable results. To start a new game (other than the first one you started), close the game and reopen it. In one of the later rooms, you'll need to enter the correct combination to open a safe. This puzzle is not implemented. Interacting with the safe is enough to unlock the Docks on the subway map. Once you reach this area, the game is effectively over.
