Cassoulet is a rich, slow-cooked casserole originating in the south of France, containing meat (typically pork sausages, goose, duck and sometimes mutton), pork skin (couennes) and white haricot beans. The dish is named after its traditional cooking vessel, the cassole, a deep, round, earthenware pot with slanting sides. Cassoulet is also sold in France as a commercial product in cans and can be found in supermarkets and grocery stores across the country. Learn how to make Cassoulet by following this easy recipe.
