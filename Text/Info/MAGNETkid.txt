Hey,
Well instead of making another shooter I decided to make a puzzle/action/platformer type thing titled MagnetKid. The game is challenging but I've managed to beat it :P.

The title was a little to ambitious for me I believe, but still I tried and I don't think I did too badly :3 I'll prolly work on something smaller next, like a SmashTV type game, I dunno :P

CONTROLS:
Arrows = Move
A = Jump
S = Switch Polarity
Enter = (Accept Menu)
B (while in game) = Return to menu
M (while in game) = Mute sound
N (while in game) = Unmute sound.

-Guide-
If the MagnetKid's polarity matches the object's polarity, they will repel.
If the MagnetKid's polarity are different to the object's polarity, they will be attracted.
Spikes/Bombs/General hazards will kill you...but you have unlimited lives so...!
Find the four gameboy's to warp to bonus levels and unlock NG medals!

Anyway yeah, I just wanted to give designing a platformer game a stab, I just hope ye likeths :3
