I dreamed this up a while ago and decided to illustrate it. I did it about two weeks ago, and turned out
      pretty cool. I did it mostly to practise drawing and stuff, but It turned out nicely so... ya. It's about
      a
      guy trying to get to the color plant thing and being frozen by an evil sun. It's all kinda strange.
      Anyways,
      it's almost a minute long, but it wasnt supposed to be anything epic, so that's why it's short.
