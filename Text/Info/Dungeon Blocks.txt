Dungeon Blocks is a Tetris inspired game in which you build holes, not lines. Depending on the dimensions of the hole, it becomes a block dungeon for a certain imp. In each stage new types of holes and dungeons to build to clear the level are introduced. Getting one star in each level is rather easy, but scoring 250000 or building a dragon treasury as in the last level is a serious challenge!
