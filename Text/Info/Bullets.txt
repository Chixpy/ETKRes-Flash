Put your strategic avoiding skills to the test, as you try to avoid your worst enemy... YOURSELF. Take control of a ship in space and test your skills on 100 levels. Each level you must shoot and then avoid your shots for XX amount of time. You'll be asked to avoid pistol shots, shotgun shots, grenade shrapnel, etc. Careful, each weapons has recoil.
