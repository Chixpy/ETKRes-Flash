Game Instructions:
Click on the bugs to help Fribbit eat the numbers that solve the equations...  and watch out for the mean crocodile!

TIP:
If you really want to beat the "pro" level, I suggest that you play in a team of two -- one to just eat bugs and watch out for that mean croc and one to do the math and tell the other one what number to eat!
