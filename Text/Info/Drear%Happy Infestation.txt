This was a project I started almost exactly two weeks ago. I had some empty vicks boxes and a simple
      character in my mind, as well as lots of sketchbook to be used, so after many many hours of hard work, here it
      is!
      The idea was that it would be really cool if somewhere there was just a button that made everything happy.
      It's 2515 frames, 100.8 seconds running at 24 fps. Hope you like it! By the way, I respond to all reviews,
      so
      feel free to say hi! Also, I take no ownership for the pattern used on the inside of the building, it was done
      by
      an amazing pattern artist, Esther Hong, for a website called nakedandangry.com. cheers!
