"Did You Hear That?" is a collaboration of sound and animation from 10 talented artists here on
      Newgrounds. All participants in this collab were hand selected by me, Goat-Man. All activities in this collab
      were
      conducted through privatemessages. Meaning members had no interaction with each other, and never knew who they
      were working with. Each member was told to hand in one random sound effect.The sound was allowed to be
      anything
      that they wanted. I took all handed in sound effects, and organized them into a random order. Each member was
      given this compiled sound file, and weren't allowed to change it in any way. Since there were no
      interactions
      between members, each animation came out 100% different because they were unable to take ideas from one
      another. -
      The name "Did You Hear That?" came from the idea that each sound effect was interpreted differently.
      So
      each member heard and invisioned a different scene than the others. This is actually the first time that
      members
      in the collab will be able to see everyone that they worked with throughout the project. But, that was really
      just
      me being a tease more than anything :P - Thank you so much to the members for your hard work and efforts. This
      was
      a blast to work on, and I loved organizing it! I hope you all love how it turned out as much as I do.
