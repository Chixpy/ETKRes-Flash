As with the predecessors of this game, the objective is to bomb your enemies. But there is a twist here. You have to pop them too. You also may use items like darts to pop your bubble or force fields to be temporarily immune to damage. A tip would be to try and corner your opponent. Always be on the lookout for items to help you win. Avoid the monsters in the game at all costs.
