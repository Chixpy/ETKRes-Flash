In this game you have to connect similar ICs of the same colors. When you connect them, you should ensure that the wires do not overlap or cross each other. If this were to happen, then it will result in a short circuit taking place. For connecting two red colored ICs, you have to use a red pen, and to wipe out a line, you should click on the �Undo� button. If you click on �Reset� button, it will undo the entire level of the game played. After you complete the first stage, the second and third will open simultaneously. Skipping one stage will result in yet another stage opening up, ensuring that there are two stages open at any given moment of time. There are a total of 20 stages to this game to be completed. If you want to replay the level you have already completed, you can always go back to that level. What are you waiting for? Have fun while playing this unique Circuit Game.
