I wanted to see if I could make a 2D fighting game engine using HaxeFlixel. The answer was a resounding �kinda�. Try to do a Wrench-doken!

CONTROLS
Player 1: WASD to move, SPACE to attack
Player 2: UP, LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN to move, ENTER to attack
Press ESC to return to title

Demo made using HaxeFlixel.
