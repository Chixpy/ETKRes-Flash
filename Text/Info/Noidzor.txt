A mystical and dark twist on the 'Breakout' concept. We've taken the concept and made it relatively unique, with features and game-play never done before. The game features skill advancement, health and mana, strategy, power attacks (that you can upgrade), and much more. You also play as a monster, and instead of trying to keep the ball (orb) from falling off, your main objective is to break the seals and avoid the attacks. It was a fun game to develop and I'm sure you'll love it and maybe even become addicted :P
