******************** This is part 5 of a 5 part series!!! ******************** It's day 5 in Alaska, last night wasn't so bad sleeping in a real bed. It would have been better if Bill didn't snore so loud. At least he is feeling better today. There's a loud noise outside, you should really go check it out! Good luck and have fun playing!
