An experiment in cyclic game design. Puzzle platformer set in a cylindrical world. It�s very short, but hope you like it anyway :) We made this game for the Experimental Gameplay Project back in April 2010. Recently got some traffic from stumbleupon, so I thought I�d redirect it here so people could comment :)
