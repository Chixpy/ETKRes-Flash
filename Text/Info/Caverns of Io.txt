A wonderfully retro space shooter maze game. In ascii we trust! :)

Original comments from the developer's Newgrounds: 

You have been sent to explore Io, tasked with exploring each cavern in search of potential resources to mine. Armed with a simple cannon, your goal is to explore all thirty caverns, and clear them of any hostile ships.

Each level presents unique terrain and challenges. To survive, you'll need to learn to use each cavern's features to your advantage.
