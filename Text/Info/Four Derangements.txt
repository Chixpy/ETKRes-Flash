A man with nine eyes observes the inhabitants of a mysterious, featureless complex of buildings. Endless dreams, premonitions of doom and ghosts of loves long dead become intermingled in this four part derangement of the comics form. Originally created to coincide with an exhibition of my work at SICAF 2009 in South Korea.
