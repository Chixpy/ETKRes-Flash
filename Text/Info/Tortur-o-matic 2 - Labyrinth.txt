Use the arrow keys to move, not clicking on the in-game arrows.
More torture, more blood and more pain in the much improved sequel to "Tortur-o-matic!" If you've played the first one you know what to expect: Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to select a path through the maze, causing as much pain to your stick-victim as possible on the way!
