This fish is insane. He keeps growing and growing and eats everything he saw. He upgrades his all parts of the body like jaws, spine, and even a torpedo. But watch out for the sharks and crocodiles, you're gonna be eaten by them. And also, there is a giant octopus waiting for you and ready to eat you. But fear not, because you're a Pyranha
