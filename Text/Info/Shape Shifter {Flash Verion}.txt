Shape up or ship out!
Step right up folks to the greatest puzzle game in town! Grab shapes from the feeder and put them in the right gap as rows whiz by before your eyes.
Dump what you don't need in the discard bin. When the paint bottle appears, use it wisely and fill in the blank shapes. Now...on with the show!
