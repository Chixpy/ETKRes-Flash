Legend of Kupapa is a strategy platformer where you take the role of Kupapa, an outcast warrior shunned for his unsettling anger in an otherwise peaceful world. One day the Kupapians fall under invasion and panic strikes home! Nobody knows how to fight, nobody knows what to do. That is, nobody but Kupapa.
