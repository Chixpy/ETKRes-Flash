Play stage 1 here: portal/view/566055
Play stage 2 here: portal/view/566291
Play stage 3 here: portal/view/566564
Play stage 4 here: portal/view/566734
Play stage 6 here: portal/view/567109

CONTROLS:
Arrow Keys - Move / Aim
Z - Shoot
X - Jump
C - Change Weapons
Spacebar - Pause / Open Map

You can also use WASD to move and JKL to shoot/jump/change weapons, however on some browsers/keyboards you may run into issues with too many keys being pressed at once, nothing I can do about that.

========================
PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER:
========================
If you have a PC Gamepad, I highly recommend using the Joy2Key Software. You can download it: here: http://bit.ly/NCx4h

Saving - Progress through the stage is saved automatically at every major checkpoint. If you have to leave and come back, your progress will still be there!

Bugs - If you do find a bug, please report it to me via PM. Be as descriptive as you can, I can't fix things if I don't know what went wrong!

Sticky Keys Bug - If the keys feel like they're sticking, character keeps running after you let go, please read the third post in this thread: http://www.newgrounds.com /bbs/topic/1123318
This is a bug with some browsers/systems and there's really nothing I can do to fix it.

Update: Version 2 is now up. I made Polmire easier on easy.
