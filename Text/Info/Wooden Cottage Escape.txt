The 477th escape game from 123bee.com. In the foggy morning, I went for jogging.. Suddenly I heard some noise from a wooden house nearby..  Out of curiosity, I went inside the home where the door was open.. Unknowingly the house owner locked me inside the home.. And I was  trapped.. Friends!!! Help me to getaway from this house..
