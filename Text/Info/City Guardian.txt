City Guardian is an action-skill game that will test your reaction speed and skill as you try to change color of your character to match the color of your enemies.
Change your colors and hover over them to kill them. Be careful, every enemy that gets past you will make your health bar drop. When your health reaches 0 the level is over.
Use upgrades and power-ups to make your monster faster and stronger in order to take out enemies faster.
