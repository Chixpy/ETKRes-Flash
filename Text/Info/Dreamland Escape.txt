The 554th escape game from 123bee.com. After enjoying a movie with my friend, I fell asleep. In my dream, I went into a dreamland. When I was enjoying there, suddenly a strange person said that if I have to go out, I have to find the way by myself. Help me to find all the clues and logically correlate them to come out of the dreamland.
