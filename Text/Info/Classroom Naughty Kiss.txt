You just moved into a new city with your family and they sign you in a new fancy school. It's a prestigious school and your parents want only the best things for you! In your classroom you have a lot of cute boys, but you like only one. He wants to kiss you, but no one can see him do that because if your teacher or your classmates sees you she will take you directly to the principal. So be careful and kiss when no one looks. Good luck and have fun!
