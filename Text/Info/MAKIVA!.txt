<How to play>
Control with the mouse.
Harvest by clicking crops.

The status is displayed on the bottom.
From the left to right: Scoop, harvest basket, remaining time, number of coins.

Since you can not harvest more than the basket's capacity, you can get coins by clicking on the entrance of the ranch when it is full.

Earn 10,000 coins before the remaining time becomes 0.
The difficulty rises according to the number of coins, and the ranch becomes more lively. There are a few coins that you can get with items delivered in the small frame on the top right.

When the scoop's X disappears, you can dig a crack by clicking it. Enjoy whatever comes out.
