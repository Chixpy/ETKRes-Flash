Pou decided it was time for him to get a job, so he earned a spot as a sous chef in a restaurant. But the chef is very particular about his kitchen and doesn't let Pou do anything then stir the soup. But Pou wants to learn, so help him cook while the chef is not looking. You can help him cut some carrots into tiny slices, use a flip flop to kill all the bugs, eat a delicious and fresh fruit salad, learn to plate food by placing some lettuce, tomatoes, meat and herbs in an artistic way, pour tomato soup equally in three bowls, wash the dishes and serve the customers the food they desire. You have to complete all these tasks before the time runs out. Whenever the chef comes along, Pou has to stop everything he is doing and stir his soup. Good luck playing this exciting game!
