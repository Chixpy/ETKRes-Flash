You are a wanderer without a shadow. You don't remember much about your past, but you've heard that the nefarious Queen of Shadows takes them from those that she recruits to do her bidding. Collect loot, gamble and level up your character to better battle the Queen's minion horde so that you may learn the truth about you and your shadow.
