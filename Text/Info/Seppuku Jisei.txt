Seppuku Jisei! Nanji made desu ka? The battle is already lost. Your own soldiers are gone, forsaken you! As a noble Samurai, you know the drill, the stab. You will have to die with honor intact. Seppuku, ritual suicide by cutting your own abdomen. Short, dark, and heavily focused on action, this game is about the Samurai honor and, of course, poetry.
