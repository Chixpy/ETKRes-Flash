This is a great adventure of the two friends that can do together some heavy things. They are two cute aliens who just want to find their ship and come back home. It is medieval age and they were patrolling the Earth, suddenly the ship broke and they had to teleport but the ship had gone, I heard that it is near the castle. Help them to find their ship. The main game feature is that heroes have different abilities separately and together. If they connected then it is easy to move heavy blocks, if separated the lower alien can jump higher and the upper can climb along the rope. The game has 18 puzzle levels, have fun.
