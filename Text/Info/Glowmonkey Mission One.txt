The Dolly Lamba is underwater stealing oil from countries around the world to run his cloning factory. You must stop him before he creates his army of sheep, and tries to take over the world! Controls may take one game to get used to, but then we think you will enjoy the fast action. Each level has a trick to pass. HINT: Shoot lambs first(to stun), then tail whip them(to slam). CONTROLS: Arrow keys to move. A, S, D for throwing, shooting, and whipping. Space Bar to jump.
