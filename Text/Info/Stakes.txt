Stakes is a action-packed highscore-based game in which the player uses stakes to destroy blocks, get combos, reach new heights and avoid a variety of spikes, bombs, and turrets.

Stakes is a mix of genres that requires quick reflexes AND quick thinking- strategy will always be rewarded with high combos.

Stakes is lovingly created using a retro pixel art Game Boy style, chiptune sounds with a modern touch, and tough-but-fair gameplay.
