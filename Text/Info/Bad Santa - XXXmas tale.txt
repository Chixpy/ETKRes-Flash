Santa Claus is a human too. He also feels stress at some time. Who among us doesn't like to drink a couple of beer after the hard working day? Especially if only a peevish wife and batch of hungry elves wait you at home. The only thing you can do in that case is to drink into unconsciousness and go to brothel! P.S.: GameOfDesire's crew wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
