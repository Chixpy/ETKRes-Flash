The most challenging experience you'll have with a clock since learning how to tell time. Twelve O is an original puzzle game about setting every clock in each level to 12. Inside the game's 27 levels are connected clocks, clocks that move in opposite directions, and even ones that move at different speeds. Twelve O provides a fresh challenge to pass the time while you play with it.
