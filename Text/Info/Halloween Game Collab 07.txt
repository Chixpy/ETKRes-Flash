***Update, some glitches have been fixed (bear with us) :P Halloween Game Collab 07 - A collab of Halloween-related and themed games. A game collab is pretty hard to pull off, but with the tons of ideas, initiative and work that was shown to get it to where it is now, so I would like to thank all those who participated (in no particular order): XceeD St1k Jindo Nicholas-Deary DreamworX Souled Saint-kilich Wurmy1029 We hope you all enjoy the insane amounts of effort, especially seeing as participants only had approx 3 weeks to input into this. - Coolio-N
