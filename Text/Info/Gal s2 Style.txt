Hey Hey! So my sister :iconnummyz: told me to draw some games for her. This is the first one so far.

The sparkles can be moved around and the same goes for the stars. If there are any mistakes or glitches do tell and the loading screen is a mochi ad cause thats how Nummyz made it. No complains from me ^^; You can always just skip the ad.

I worked on this the past week for about 3 days maybe....? Well minus about half of each day due to animal crossing and well it took a lot less time..
maybe a day then..
I had jury duty and then got sick...

Anyways Gal s2 Style
