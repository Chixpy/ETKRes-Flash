********** This is part 1 of a 5 part series! ********** You have been at sea for days, ever since you were in a terrible storm that sunk your sail boat. You managed to escape on a life raft but now you are almost out of food and water. You might not make it if you don't get rescued soon! Good luck and have fun playing!
