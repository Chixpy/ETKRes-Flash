So Irukandji, Intagonist-six, and 7h3b0x-13 duke it out. And then Purplepanda1 shows up but he's changed. He
      basically pwns Irukandji, 7h3b0x-13, and surrounds Intagonist-six. Luckily, our hero, TheLOL_Flashlight comes back
      into the game to get a little revenge at Irukandji. But, he is dead before he got there so he just survives as
      long as he can waiting for his rival. TheLOL_Flashlight encounter his new challenge, Purplepanda1.
