Upgrade your truck, then launch it and try to get all of the achievements!

In this game, you start off with a slow truck with hexagon wheels, and try to launch it off a ramp. The further you get, the more points you get, which can be used to buy upgrades such and round wheels, a better ramp, or even fireworks and rockets for a boost. These upgrades will help you complete all 8 achievements, upon which you will unlock a super mystery prize.

Please note this is a SPINOFF of Monster Truck Maniac. It is not monster truck maniac 3 :)
