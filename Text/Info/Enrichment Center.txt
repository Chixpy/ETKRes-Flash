Finally here is the FINAL VERSION of the Enrichment Center (our first game). We added several of mechanics into the game. Remember: this was just us testing the waters of flash. Something entertaining, yet simple. for now at least. Same story as the Beta: This is a fan based game off of Valve's Portal. This is another part of Aperture Science. This takes place before the portal gun was completed, so this game is like Portal .5. You're an Aperture Science employee starting to think that you will never going home again. So you start to escape from the Enrichment Center. and remember, there's 2 different endings! Hope you Enjoy!
