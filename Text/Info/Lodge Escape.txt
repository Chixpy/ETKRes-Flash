The 522nd escape game from 123bee.com. I was on a research trip with my friend. During the trip, we were supposed to stay at a Lodge in a small village. Middle of the night, i got a shearing noise that pierced my ears. Next thing I knew, my friend is missing.  I pounded on the doors for help but it's of no use. I have to escape from this lodge and spot my friend. Will you guide me..?
