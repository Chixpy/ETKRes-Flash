DESCRIPTION: ================== Cyndre Phase is a futuristic action game in which you defend your base from a continuous flow of enemy rockets. The game is designed around the idea of "three". There are three levels, each level has three waves, with three enemy types per level, three types of power-ups, and three over-lapping combo-systems. Each type of enemy rocket has its own unique mechanic and behaviour, and the group of three on each level is designed to compliment each other, allowing for creative use of the combo-systems to score points.
