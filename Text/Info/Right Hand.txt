The action of this 3D first person shooter is taking place in Chicago in the 1930s. Al Capone’s mafia is controlling the whole city and the situation looks nearly hopeless. But there is one man who can prevent the mafia from capturing the city – it’s you. It’s useless to act forcefully, so you’ll have to work as a double agent.
