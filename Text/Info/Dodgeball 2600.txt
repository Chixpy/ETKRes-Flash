A very simple one button game. This game channels the early phases of the video game industry. One button, one action, low res, small screen, monocolor, limited. This is all about Dodgeball! Literally nothing left to say about this game but Dodgeball 2600 seems like a game released in...chenen....Atari 2600! Controls: Catch= Left-click
