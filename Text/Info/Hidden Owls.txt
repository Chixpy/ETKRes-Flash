Owls are hidden all around the place!! Shoot the Owls with archer's bow and arrows. Use mouse to shoot the Owls. Avoid clicking needlessly, as otherwise your time will get reduced. If finding last three Owls is difficult in any level, use the hint option to point out the Owls, but using hint option each time will cost you 100 points.
