Hey everyone! Basically, there's a guy with a scarf who walks and finds a TV and then another character
      SWOOPS IN FROM ABOVE and steals it and breaks it. Very frustrating experiences, these television thefts. They
      happen to me from time to time. Please try to appreciate it for it's visual merit, that's what we were
      working on. It's not a big plot piece or anything like that. - This was a project Nick and I started up a
      few
      weeks ago, he sent me the base file with the (AWESOME) backgrounds in a similar montage to the end result, and
      then I added the characters and a couple more shots and stuff. It was fun. - It was a good way for us both to
      get
      something out for the winter competition; he only had THAT DAY to make his base file because of studying for
      exams
      and things, so it was cool how he could do something, and then I could pick up on it and finish it off. Its
      fun to
      work like that because it means you don't have to do everything but you still feel important. :) - The
      animation itself is kind of cool, I think. Haha. I like how the characters turned out, and the roughness of
      their
      lines against the super smooth, professional lines of the background. I was having a lot of fun trying out
      complicated movements (like when the scarfless character jumps up for the first time and swoops over) and
      I'm
      happy with the result. I really like animating characters now, its fun. - The music is awesome. Brian Mejia is
      great and it's a wonderful thing he's done by making his stuff available in the audio portal. I really
      love the song. 920 frames, 24 frames to a second. 300,000 symbols. hope you like it! Merry christmas! Moro and
      Nicholas :)
