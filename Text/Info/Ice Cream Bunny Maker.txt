Sorry about the obnoxious watermark! I've run into my games in a lot of places so hopefully this will deter would be thieves. This game is also hosted over at Dressupgames.com with my permission so feel free to play if there as well [link]


Inspired by a past deviation



FAQ #502: Can I submit things which I made using different "games" like a doll maker or with other character generators?

My Terms of Use:
You can post screenshots of the character you create in your SCRAPS gallery only as long as you also place a link to this game in your comments. If you place screenshots of your bunny in your main gallery it is considered a form of art theft since you did not create any elements of the character yourself and will be deleted by DA admins

You may not make adoptables out of the game and use them to make any type of profit (money, points,or subscriptions) even if proper credit is given. You can however make them and give them away for free but must always credit me as the original artist and link back to this game.
