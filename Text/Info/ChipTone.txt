Hello! ChipTone is a free tool for generating sound effects, primarily for games but they could be used for anything you like!

I'm currently working to flesh out the sampler, the vocoder and the sequencer. You can still use it at this early stage, and your feedback/bug reports would be very welcomed!

I hope you find this tool useful, and if you make anything cool using it, I'd love to see!
