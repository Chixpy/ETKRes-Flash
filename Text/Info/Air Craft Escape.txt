The 96th escape game from 123bee.com  We will be releasing escape games on every Mondays and Thursdays.  While traveling in the plane, a terrorist hijacks the plane and kills all the passengers except one, and the pilot is in an unconscious state. Fortunately, the person who escapes kills the terrorist. Imagine yourself to be in the position of the person who has escaped, and try to save the pilot and make a safe exit from the plane. An exciting prospect at hand!
