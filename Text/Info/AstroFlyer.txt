A cool new airplane game, just use the mouse to guide the AstroFlyer through the skies and collect the stars for points. This is my first game, it was released this summer and got approx 600 thousand gameplays. I know it’s not much, but I’m still proud. I admit it’s a little bit hard and frustrating. My next flash game will be much easier.
