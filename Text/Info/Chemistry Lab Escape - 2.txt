The 59th escape game from 123bee.com We will be releasing escape games on every Mondays and Thursdays. You are trapped in a chemistry lab, where the hazardous chemical bottle breaks, and starts to reduce the oxygen level in air. You will have to escape from the lab before thirty minutes elapses, as otherwise the hazardous chemical will completely destroy you, or else, find out another way to escape from the lab!
