At the end of the game the computer may be stuck, that probably means he can not create any more words.
Play your tiles to score big!
To start, select six letters at random, then play your letter tiles on the board to create a new word. Each play must cross one of the words already on the board.
Each letter is worth points, with rarer letters like X or Z having the highest value. Pick your computer opponent's difficulty and jump in!
