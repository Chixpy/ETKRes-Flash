This short, hands, my first 2008 submission, was created to commemorate the ending of my
      holidays. I dont really look forward to school tomorrow, but at least now I have something to remember this
      christmas by. I had this dream a little while ago with hands climbing a ladder like its done in the animation,
      so
      I made it, found a sound I was fond of to go with it, and wrapped it up. I used 14 frames per second because
      I've
      been feeling bad for a while now because each time I start working on another project, it takes longer than
      the
      previous one had. For the purposes of humour, I'll call this resentment 'tom fulp syndrome', because he's
      expressed the same feelings before. ;) anyways, its kinda fun animating with no smoothing. 21 seconds, 14fps,
      550x360. Love it to bits, Morrowdays
