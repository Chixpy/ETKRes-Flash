Release date stands for the Newgrounds release, the game was 	available before on MoFunZone but it's no longer in that website, so the original release date may be lost.
Lucas Paakh / Kajenx is uncredited, but he spoke about creating this game in his early update posts on Newgrounds, and some sfx/gfx in common can be identified between this game and others by him.
Quickling will take you on a fun adventure both visually and in game-play. Play as the quick demon and employ your magic against the fairy swarms as you try to pass the trials in this new coming-of-age platformer, that features weather changes live before your eyes and awesome audio tracks.
