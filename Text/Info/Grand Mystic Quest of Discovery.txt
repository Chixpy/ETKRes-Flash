The game has no audio, so don't be surprised if you don't hear anything. 

This game's controls are kind of confusing and there's no in-game tutorial, so here they are:

- Left/right arrow keys to move
- Up/down arrow keys to move vertically on ladders, also to read scrolls and enter doors
- Z key to jump, also to close scrolls (when opened)
- Ctrl + F2 to restart

Spell controls only work when you have them:
- Q key for the first spell
- W key for the second spell
- A key (hold) for the third spell
- S key for the fourth spell
This game very accurately emulates the C64 graphic style and colour palette. It has very solid gameplay, the elements/spells all work great together to create a set of clever puzzles for you to solve.
