Play with your friends or alone in this retro Splatoon demake! :D

How To Play

There are three game modes:

1v1, where you fight against a friend and try to make the more splats

Turf War, where your try to cover a bigger surface than your opponent with your ink

Octo Mode, where you fight the Octarians in solo and try to survive

There are also three weapons, the sames as in the original game:

The Splattershot, a simple gun which just shoots ink

The Roller, which covers the surface that you move on

The Charger, a sniper which is convenient for long lines of ink

Directionnal arrows to move, P to shoot ink, O to squid, L to lock direction and M to throw a bomb for Player 1 (Blue).

Z, Q, S and D to move, H to shoot ink, G to squid, V to lock direction and B to throw a bomb for Player 2 (Orange).

Oh and of course, Space to Start.
