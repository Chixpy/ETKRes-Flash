Money Metropolis allows young children to navigate a multi-dimensional world, making life decisions that will affect whether their virtual bank accounts shrink or grow. Completing tasks like raking leaves, mowing lawns and babysitting adds money to their virtual accounts that can be saved or spent in the virtual store.
