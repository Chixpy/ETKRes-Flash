MR.Bean jumps out the plane crazily to catch his teddy which, the old lady throws out of the plane in anger. Now he has to land safely without hurting himself. You can help him do it by holding onto lighter objects like balloon umbrella etc. Avoid the heavy objects as he will only fall with a thud. Take care and help him land safely and enjoy the game.
