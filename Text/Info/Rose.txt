>>>FRONT PAGE!! THANKS A MILLION TOM <3! I was bored one day and was listening to one of my fave songs {ROSE}, when I decided to make a game for it. I made this in a few days. - Rose - is an abstract music based game that keeps you going and feeling the beat. If you like this music, look at more of cornandbeans' work in the NG audio portal. Have Fun, Coolio-N
