The 519th escape game from 123bee.com. I was invited by my collage-mate for some help in his thesis work. I went to his villa, no one is there except me and my friend. Late night, in the comfort of the luxurious villa,  I felt asleep. When I woke up, I found myself alone in the villa. My friend is missing!!! I pounded on the doors and shouted at the top of my voice, but no response. The door is locked outside. Will you please help me to find the spare key to open the door..?
