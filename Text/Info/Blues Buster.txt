No, I did not miss a period in the original description.
The aim of the game is to suck up as many bad Moodies as you can within a minute Move your mouse to search around the city for floating Moodies. If you see a negative Moodi, click your mouse on it, and it will be sucked into your Moodi machine. Points are awarded for sucking up a bad Moodi, but be quick as points are deducted the longer the float. Points are deducted for collecting positive Moodies! Good luck!
