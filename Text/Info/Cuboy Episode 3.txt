A poem from the Edible Castle boys:

      Episode 3, Episode 3.
      It's a joy to see, Episode 3.
      We took two years,
      drank lots of beers...

      ...and yeah well this happened.

      Cuboy's latest fashion craze is the circus! MMM baby! And this episode introduces a new main character that
      will
      be featuring throughout the series, Cuboy's annoying fellow co-worker: Ranksworth (voiced by the beautiful
      Joshua
      Tomar!).

      Please check out the website's Cutoys (that's TOY, not BOY) section for a load of print-out, cut-out,
      chill-out,
      rock-out Cuboy character TOYS! Totally free, and totally up for getting thrown off tall building (it won't
      hurt,
      they're made of paper!!).

      Also, join the forums and get ready for the upcoming release of Edible Castle and Cuboy's first ever game:
      Back to
      the Cubeture: Episode 1! A point 'n click extravaganza! Here's a little sneak peak to wet your whistle:
