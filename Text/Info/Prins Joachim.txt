Yes, this is literally nothing. A screen saying 'delete me' and nothing else. I don't know what the story is behind this game, for as much as the other games by Sosker were terrible, this is just unbelievably bad for a 200kb SWF. It's being maintained here to keep the Sosker collection on Kongregate complete, but may god have mercy on the soul of the man who requested his entire Kongregate library, because I sure won't if I ever find him.
