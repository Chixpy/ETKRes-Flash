******************** This is part 1 of a 4 part series ********************* Your parents thought it would be good for you to get out of the house so they sent you on a hiking trip at Yellowstone National Park. You lost your balance and you fell down a cliff! Now you are all alone in the wilderness and must figure out how to survive and escape! Good luck and have fun playing!
