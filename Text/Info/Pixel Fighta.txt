Pixel Fighta is another little project of mine. Took 2 days to program this little air fighting game. It's very simple: The game consists of a endurance gameplay, where you have up to 500 levels to go through. As you go along, enemies will get bigger, faster, and the tunnel you are flying it will gradually become smaller and smaller. I've included hi scores, don't be surprised your score goes up in the millions, that's normal. I hope you'll enjoy it!
