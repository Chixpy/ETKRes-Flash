***This is part one in a 5 part series. *** Your parents went out of town and you stayed home alone. There was a meteor shower and the city was destroyed along with your house. Thank goodness you made it out safe. Now you have to survive on your own! It's safe in your back yard, for now. Good luck and have fun!
