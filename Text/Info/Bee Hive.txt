Help the bee to make it reach its hive by removing the objects which are preventing the bee from reaching the hive.  To make the bee reach the hive rapidly, remove the obstacles quickly. If you fail to remove the obstacles within the given time duration, the bee falls off from its position. Complete all the levels in a short duration to get the maximum score. To restart the level at any time, press the reset button.
