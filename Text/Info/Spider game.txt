To win Spider Solitaire you need to create 8 stacks of cards - King all the way down to the ace of the same suit. If you run out of moves you may put down more cards by clicking on the pile in the bottom corner of the screen. You can put cards of different suits on top of each other but, beware it can get tricky! You may play with one suit, two suits, or - if you're really good - play four suits!
