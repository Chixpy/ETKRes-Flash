This is a collection of 10 Flash mini-games. You can either just play each game and have fun or try to get as high of a score for each mini-game as possible and submit it to a highscore table. You can pause the game at any time by pressing 'p' in which you have a menu to change any of the game's settings such as quality, music, and difficulty. Difficulty affects how much your score is multiplied. This game auto-saves your settings. If at any time you experience any bugs, report them to me and just refresh the page. Have fun!
