CONTROLS:
Arrow Keys - Move / Aim
Z - Shoot
X - Jump
C - Change Weapons
Spacebar - Pause / Open Map

You can also use WASD to move and JKL to shoot/jump/change weapons, however on some browsers/keyboards you may run into issues with too many keys being pressed at once, nothing I can do about that.

========================
PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER:
========================
If you have a PC Gamepad, I highly recommend using the Joy2Key Software. You can download it: here: http://bit.ly/NCx4h

Saving - Progress through the stage is saved automatically at every major checkpoint. If you have to leave and come back, your progress will still be there!

Bugs - If you do find a bug, please report it to me via PM. Be as descriptive as you can, I can't fix things if I don't know what went wrong!

Sticky Keys Bug - If the keys feel like they're sticking, character keeps running after you let go, please read the third post in this thread: http://www.newgrounds.com /bbs/topic/1123318
This is a bug with some browsers/systems and there's really nothing I can do to fix it.

Well, this is it, the final stage. I hope those that have enjoyed the game up until now agree that I've saved the best for last, just don't expect the journey left to come to be an easy one.
