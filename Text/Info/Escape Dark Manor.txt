After a long day at work, you were headed home. A horse ran in front of your car, you swerved to avoid hitting it and you crashed your car. Your leg is broken, your car is broken and you are 39 miles from home. Thank goodness there's a manor up the road. Go explore it and see if you can find a way home!
