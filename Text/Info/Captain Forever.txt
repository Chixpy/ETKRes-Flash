The International Space Station, so far as I'm aware, does not have laser cannons. Nor does it have giant rocket boosters. I do not believe that you have ever taken it for a joy ride. However, I am surprisingly familiar with that scenario. I have played Captain Forever. Described as "Meccano Asteroids", Captain Forever sees you pilot your modular spacecraft with one hand, while simultaneously constructing it with the other.
