You’re a ghost who fell through the cracks of the system when you died. You see, all ghosts are required to pay taxes…SOUL taxes. For eight years you’ve been haunting this corporate building that was built on top of your old house, totally oblivious to your Soul Taxes, and now your delinquency is coming back to haunt YOU! The reaper is here to collect every last soul you owe, but since he’s a nice guy he’s willing to help you out. All you have to do is totally murder a bunch of people and steal their souls. Good luck!
