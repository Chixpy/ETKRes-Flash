In a world where people try to eat your brain, you have to fend off the partially deceased using only an ice cream van and your wits.

You can play as multiple characters, enter massive boss battles and save the world in over 10,000 ways in this retro text adventure.

Many have tried, many have failed, but can you keep your internal munchies internal? Can you escape the rank of N00b? And can you retain your dignity at the same time?
