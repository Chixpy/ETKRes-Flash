Now this is the ultimate holiday simulation (... at least it was in 1984)

PS.: Check the music credit I added to the title screen for a longer version of Kauski's "Step Off My Face" (Shark Song) - still a raw     mix yet but don't hesitate to leave some comments! He'll try to kick out a version of the Pixlvadortrack, too!

Stay tuned :)
