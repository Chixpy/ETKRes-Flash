Bomee's last dating sim for the 2007 year, completely drawn with a mouse, with backgrounds from real pictures taken by my sister in Monteal Canada. You play as Jenna Moonlight for an unlimited amount of  time as the war between the living and those infected by the Blood Pond Ensue. The Blood Prince is the son of Fantom and Ari from Love Dating Sim 1, taken away from the lovers by the Jealous Blood Pond Craven. Those with Vampric blood are not affected by the fumes from the Pond. Those affected become vampires like Stas. And those with witch blood like Jenna mixed with Vampric blood are very powerful-- you as Jenna can choose to destroy the world or save it... with eight different endings and five original characters...

This may be a very simple dating sim, but it's like no other with an original storyline and hentai-less graphics/gameplay. Is it love or lust at first bite? You decide.
