You're running the most popular lollipop stall in a park. Kids started coming to the stall. Identify the desired item of the kids, which gets denoted for each kid. Prepare and serve the Lollipop before the kids' waiting time exceeds. If you have prepared the wrong item, throw it into the trash bin. In each level, try to satisfy maximum kids and get the target points within the given time duration to proceed to tougher levels. Make sure you pick the right candy sticks and lollipop shapes. Enjoy!
