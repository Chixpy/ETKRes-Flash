So TheLOL_Flashlight gets angered and has this "grudge" agaisnt Irukandji. So as usual, more blah blah blah
      happens and new beta testers joins the game; Intagonist-six (Light Blue) and Jy-555 (Cyan). And in other words we
      find that the fan thing which TheLOL_Flashlight carries around enhances the person wielding it... uhm. more
      awesome i suppose. And towards the end, sh** goes down.. dig?
