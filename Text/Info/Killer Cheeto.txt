The 4399 version was already hacked for unlimited lives and ammo, but has also been hacked by ThePowerPlayer to completely remove the sitelock, which uses a specific HTTP port (s4.4399.com:8080) and is thus impossible to recreate using the Redirector. The original SWF has been left in its original location.
Play as Killer Cheeto as you pass the restricted area of Wise Inc. Beware of the end boss, his name "The big magic cheese-doodle powered floating Steve Buscemi cyborg monster boss master thingy" strikes fear into the hearts of all people.

Cute hmmm almost fun game. Enjoy. A license for this game was purchased from the developer, please do not copy.
