Ripple Runner was originally made in 48 hours for round 29 of Ludum Dare. The theme was "Beneath the Surface", so I made a Bit.trip Runner-style rhythm game with game boy-esque graphics and chiptune music. This is probably my most famous and popular flash game to date. You could consider it my "thesis" work, since it combines a lot of my core aesthetics: Chiptune music, difficult gameplay, and pixel art.
