The 33rd escape game from 123bee.comTo curtail a little boy from reaching his hang-out, he is locked in his home before the New Year night. The boyï¿½s parents have kept the key somewhere in the room and have left the place. The key might be in a place which cannot be accessed by the boy. Use the other objects in the room and make an escape from this place. Good luck and have fun!
