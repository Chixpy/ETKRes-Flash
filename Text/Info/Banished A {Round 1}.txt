Our theme for round 1 is "Banished". A telekinetic man, a master of all nature and one whose force
      has no limits escape the mob that is chasing them out of their village. Don't forget to check out our new
      "Review" section in the menu if you're a fan of the competition. You get to see who wins and why
      and
      maybe learn a thing or two if you're an aspiring animator. :)
