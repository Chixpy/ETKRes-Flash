My second flashgame. Ho boy, this took a while.

-You may notice that some of the outfits are not 100% accurate, but that's because of his underwear. I couldn't stand to draw briefs on him and yes, it would have made the clothes stick better but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. XD So he got boxers.

- Some clothing belong with only a certain set. It's sorta like a puzzle, discovering what goes where.

- Almost all the clothing has reference to a Hey Arnold episode. If you can guess them all, you get a cookie!

- The 'Save the Jungle Movie' shirt relates to our facebook page. If you want to see the series end and possibly get a second spin-off, then come join! Or join even if you are a fan and just want to chat and have fun. :) We are very friendly and active!

I put a lot more clothing into this than I did with the other game. Hopefully you guys will like the variety. If not, then suck it up, buckos!

Arnold and the Hey Arnold! universe belongs to the wonderful Craig Bartlett.
