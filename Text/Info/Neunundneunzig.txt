Made for the Something Awful Bi-Weekly Game Jam, theme was taking a song and gamifying it. On that note, I have no idea if using a chiptuned version of a pop song is a copyright issue, if anyone wants me to take it down just let me know.
So about the game, its just your typical platformer with jumps, double jumps, and walljumps. every screen has 3 balloons, once theyre popped youll go to the next level. Theres 33 levels.
Arrow keys to move, X to do various jumps.
