A puzzle game with a twist. Each time a line is destroyed, a graphical effect is initiated. The further you go the more complex and intense these effects become. The idea of the game is to make them a part of the mechanic. In order to progress you have to deal not only with the growing difficulty but also with the increasing intensity of these effects. I hope you will enjoy this experience.
