This Lemon Frosted Lemon Cake is one of my favorite pound cakes. It is a sweet and buttery cake with a moist yet dense texture. As its name implies, it has a tangy lemon flavor that comes from adding both lemon zest (outer yellow skin of lemon) and lemon juice to the cake batter. To further enhance the lemon flavor, the cake is frosted with a simple lemon glaze (frosting). This frosting is made by combining powdered sugar with freshly squeezed lemon juice and what I like about it is how it dries to a hard and crusty glaze. A lovely cake on its own with a hot cup of tea, or you could serve it with fresh fruit.
