This is the version of Leaf Me Alone as originally submitted to Ludum Dare. Not to be confused with the post-Jam version on Addicting Games.
From Pixellovegames.com: The game is wonderful and reminds us a little bit of a cross between Fez and classic Zelda. We thoroughly enjoyed the chilled out atmosphere with the friendly open and roam-able levels in this one.
