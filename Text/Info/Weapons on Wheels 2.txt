  Hey guys, here's my latest Flash creation. An action-racing game filled with weapons and explosions. It may be a tad difficult at first for some of you, but I believe once you get the hang of the game, you'll have a great time playing it!

  Weapons on Wheels 2 is a fast-paced, action-filled racing game - with a twist. If you can't outmaneuver your opponents, you can just blast them off the road instead!
  
  Features include:
  > 12 unique racing levels, utilizing the theme of the 4 seasons.
  > Eight cars to choose from
  > Six weapons to purchase and upgrade through four different versions (each more powerful than the last)
  > Four different categories of car upgrades, again through four different versions each
  > Leaderboards for each track
  > Progress saving/loading
  > Custom bindable controls
  
  Built with Flash's Stage3D technology using the Starling framework!
