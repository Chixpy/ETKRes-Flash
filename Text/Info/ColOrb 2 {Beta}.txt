Arrow Keys or WASD to move your orb around.  Hit the red orb to get through the preloader and go to the main menu.  You can use the orb to navigate through menus.  You start with 5 lives, and a 30% dodge chance which recovers over time.  Hitting the wrong orbs will result in a red explosion and a decreas in life, or a blue explosion, and remove some of your doge chance.  The game is incomplete, but still fun to play.  Upgrades don't work.  The boss battles (every 6 levels) aren't implimented, so just finish the level (one white orb) and move on to the next one.
