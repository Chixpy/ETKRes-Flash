Take turns to play with computer or a friend to pocket the chosen colour pieces on the carom board. A turn consists of one or more strikes. A player wins by pocketing all of the pieces of their chosen colour first. Sinking the striker will cost you one piece. After pocketing the red colour piece, you must sink any of your carom men, covering it in the next shot, or else red colour piece will be returned back to the center point of the board.
