The 521st escape game from 123bee.com. I heard a strange noise from my neighborhood. The furious yelling sheared my ears. I rushed out to check out the reason. I snuck into their house to find out the truth. But, the place is very calm and no sign of yell. Understanding the situation, I turned my heels towards the door, but the automatic door gets locked. Is this a trap..? I need to find the secret codes to escape from my neighborhood.
