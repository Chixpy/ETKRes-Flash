Testing his new Iron Man 2 suit for a flight one time wasn't enough for Tony Stark, a true perfectionist when it comes to his work. He doesn't want to discover in the middle of a battle with a criminal or something worse that there is a problem or a bug. Now you can pick a configuration that better suits your taste, focusing on power, speed or strength, while attacking the drones that will try to knock you down. They were created by him for the test, but that doesn't mean they will be more kindly than the villains of other Iron Man games.
