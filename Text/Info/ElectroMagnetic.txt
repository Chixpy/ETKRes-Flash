Play as a shiny Magnet Ball in a new type of innovative platforming concept. It can magnetize onto walls and ceilings by holding �A� while moving forward. This costs energy in the process, each stage giving you a certain amount to use. There are two selectable game modes before starting, �Normal� and �Endless�. Normal Mode allows you to play the game how it was designed, with the ability of submitting a high score. Endless Mode provides unlimited amounts of energy per level, but does not let you send your score.
