It's an iMac transformer, and it meets a Zune. In case you needed some clarity.

Earlier today, I submitted this piece of work in an earlier form, and people generally seemed to feel it was too short, and that the iMac transformer needed to do something other than transform.

so, after another few hours, (added up, this has probably taken about nine) its done! Well, for now at least. The iMac transformer meets a zune that can't seem to transform, possibly because of the zune's incapability to do anything worthwile. ;)

Running at 1274 frames, speeding by at 30 frames per second, this is my most recent animation. I've done a fair bit of previously untried things, so I really appreciate any feedback and reviews that you can give me.

Thanks for checking it out! Moro

and make sure to cut 42 seconds out of your busy schedule before watching, thats how long it is :)
