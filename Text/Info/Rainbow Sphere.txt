Some people have been hacking the scorelist, just for you all to know:
Everything above 100.000 is imposible to get

If this is too hard for you, play the n00b edition:

Actionscript: Glaiel Gamer Art/Animation/Level Design: Gamecubicle

Almost all the bugs people complaint about are gone now!

Note: Make sure you have some free time! The game is pretty long.
Instructions:
Arrow keys to move, Space to jump, S to toggle sound, Q to toggle quality, B to turn of the background.

After about 6 weeks of hard work, we are proud to present to you...RAINBOWSPHERE

Its a puzzle/action game, its hard, but rewarding, once you finished the game you can even submit your highscore!

Enjoy!
