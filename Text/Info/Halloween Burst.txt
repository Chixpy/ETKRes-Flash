Move your mouse to collect the same pumpkins. Click the mouse button to create a fusion. The more pumpkins you stack at one time, the more points you'll get. Don't touch pumpkins of other shape, as the game will comes to end soon. The further you get, the harder it becomes, as the number of pumpkins increases.
