Audio track for Seraph7 (xSeraph7) - Restless was sourced from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MUU0KTN1bQ
(Update Aug. 14, 2008) A new song has been added in place of TT-In Your Face. Sorry for the inconvenience. I also added a retry button so you don't have to wait for your songs to load over and over again! Hope you enjoy the new song!

(Update: Oct. 07) WOW! 50k views! I'm very impressed on the impact of this game. You better believe that a sequel is in the making. Thanks go to Newgrounds viewers and musicians!

EDIT: Added an extra settings option, synchronization. Now you can fine tune your notes to the beat if the notes are not synchronized!

!!!TIP!!! Hold the keyboard like a guitar, the "NUMBER KEYS" are the frets, the "BACKSPACE" key is the strum bar. Use one hand to play the frets and the other to play the strum bar. Make sure you press the backspace key and the corresponding fret to play the note. Controls can be changed in the settings menu. If you're having a hard time playing, it will get easier if you practice. :)
