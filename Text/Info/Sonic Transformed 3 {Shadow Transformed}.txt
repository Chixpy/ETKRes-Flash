Ctrl-z
I spent around 6 months producing this and many of you will be through with it in a matter of minutes, which is why I have separated many of the animations and will leave it to your own to find them all. They are not hidden too difficulty because I want people to actually see them.

Inspired by retired Playshape's (Bowser's Castle, Legend of Krystal, etc) and Minus8's flash animations, I wanted to create something similar, mostly because no one else was taking the time to do so. I do not know if it is up to par with them but I tried my best and worked on this until I had no patience to look at it any further. Enjoy.
