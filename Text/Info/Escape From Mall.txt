INSTRUCTIONS
The first step in any game of this nature is to get the lay of the land. In other words, explore all the different areas and get a sense of the puzzles and collect any items you can find. Then try to put those items together, or try to use those items with virtually anything you can find. Sure, you can use your brain to figure out the best possible solution to each puzzle, but sometimes, the best strategy is to simply brute force your way through it.
