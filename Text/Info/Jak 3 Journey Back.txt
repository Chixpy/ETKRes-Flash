OKay! ALot of you seem to be having trouble double jumping! LET ME TELL YOU ALL THAT THIS IS NOT A BUG! You guys must have crappy computers cause if the game runs at a good speed you'll know how good the game is...I really do feel sorry for you guys that have it glitched up with the jumps, try finding a better PC to play it on and go to the graphics menu and switch to low detail which might help a little.

Okay WARNING:
Dial up people! The pre-loader will show up once 1,500kb of data is loaded so be patient.
The Game might also play a bit slow in the browser, so download the offline version if you have a decent pc so it wont lag on low quality.

PLEASE PLEASE! DO NOT WRITE A REVIEW UNLESS YOU PLAYED THE GAME FOR A DECENT AMOUNT OF TIME!
Okay. You can find a game guide for this game at my site, the link is in the game and in my profile. Also if you need info on your current mission, pause the game and it'll tell you what your objective is.

The controls are explained in the game, but if you forget, they are in the pause menu. Make sure to save after you beat a level. This game took me a year to make and note, one of the lines was never recorded by the voice actor so there is a crappy substitute for it in the game..but yea it'll be fixed ASAP. And Your save game might go to waste if I update the game so I'll put up a warning whenever I make any changes. Remember to Vote 5
