In this storybook-inspired chapter, we flashback to KAMIMURA's past as a young priest leading the
      order
      of a Buddhist monastery. It is here that the mysterious treasure he carries was first given to him...and it is
      here that we see the twisted roots of hatred in his student Goku's heart.
