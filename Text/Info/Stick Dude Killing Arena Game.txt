You're in control when you enter the Stick Dude Killing Arena this time! You'll have access to all the amazing weapons you've seen in the arena before, guns, grenades, molotov cocktails, dragon fist gloves and even a lightsaber! (The game is kind of clunky. It expects you to be on capslock all the time but some commands don't work with it on)
