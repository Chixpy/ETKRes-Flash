**************************************** This is part 2 of a 5 part series!!! **************************************** You made it through the night all on your own in a comfy bed. Today's journey will be a long one, with many tasks along the way. Someone was nice enough to leave you some cheese, you better eat up, you will need all the energy you can get. Good luck and have fun playing!
