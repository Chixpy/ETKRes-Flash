Hunt for Pieces of Eight!
Your eccentric, ex-pirate uncle is bequeathing his treasure to anyone in the family that can find it first. Search through the cluttered rooms of his suburban Land-ship.
View each room before and after, using your memory to spot changes and uncover hidden gold coins and gems. It's the ultimate hunt and you can get some serious booty if you're sharp enough! Savvy?
