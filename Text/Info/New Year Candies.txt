Help the snowman to collect all the candies, which dip lower and lower from the parachute, by making the snowman cut the rope with his sword to release the tied candy. Snowman's movement across the candles will fetch you more points. Avoid snow avalanches to survive, and proceed to the next level within the time duration.
