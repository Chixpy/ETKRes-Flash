Spiders are hidden all around the place!! Shoot the spiders with archers bow and arrows. Use mouse to shoot the spiders. Avoid clicking needlessly, as otherwise your time will get reduced. If finding last three spiders is difficult in any level, use the hint option to point out the mices, but using hint option each time will cost you 100 points.
