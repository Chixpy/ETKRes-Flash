The year: 2266; a science vessel owned by a private company known as the I.P.A. (Investigation of Planetary
      Anomaly) goes unresponsive near an uncharted planet after a strange artifact found in the depths of the planet's
      crust was brought aboard for research. A team of operatives from the ULMC (United Legions Marine Corps.) are sent
      in to investigate the disappearance of the crew, but find that the straightforward smash and grab operation would
      no longer be as simple as they thought.
