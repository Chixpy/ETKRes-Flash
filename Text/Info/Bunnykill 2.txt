Bunnykill is back! This time I'm submitting alone, because my co-author, Maza, grew bored of the
      fan-mail
      he was getting and I'd like to point out that, although he was vital to make this submission happen,
      I'm
      the one behind all the hard work. Anyway, the story is totally different from the first one, and even though
      some
      of the characters are the same, the roles they played before have nothing to do with this story. The
      story's
      crap anyway. Action is all that matters. Enjoy!
