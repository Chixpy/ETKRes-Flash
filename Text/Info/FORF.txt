Made in 72 hours for the Ludum Dare 40 JAM. The theme was "The  more you have the worse it is". Gaining experience will make the enemies stronger, so just open the door and get to the next level! I tried my best, I run out of time, I wanted to make more levels and deepen the mechanics, etc. This was my first time participating in Ludum Dare, it was a fun productive experience :-) NOTE:  The game is obviously incomplete but I think it's worthwhile showcasing, made with haxeflixel. WASD J / ARROW KEYS Z / 360 Controller
