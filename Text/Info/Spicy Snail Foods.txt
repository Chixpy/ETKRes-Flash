I have a feeling that today's recipe will be either LOVE it or HATE it type. It is all about the snails, the edible kinds. Yikes!!! Actually the word 'snail' for this dish is not the right translation. The sea snails I used for this recipe in Korean is called golbangyi. The snail in Korean is dalpangyi. And the next close thing is the snail. So we will call this recipe the Spicy Korean Sea Snail Salad (golbangyi muchim). A good trick to cook them and to enhance their flavour: We have recently discovered that they are much more tasty if they are cooked the way. In this game we tell you in the recipe instead of having them boiled. Give it a try.
