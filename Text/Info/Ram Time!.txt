Since the time of antiquity the four eyed-goat has willed that the gem be brought whilst upon the ramming squire's rite and fate, forsooth. Three bravest, lead by a wise man of 20 years, a wizard, have falled to the call of the tradition. Two are half cousins by marriage related to the wizard, a double cousin to the second brother on the mother's side, three generations down to the king. Doeth fueleth the irrepresible desire to ram their path, a new way of being and proclaim their masculinity as many moons before their borning-day, the phallis piercing upon each tower after another, till all collapse to dust and rubble, uniting as one, the kingdoms sure to follow. Go forth and rule and cleanse the land of wicked shadows, clean terrain of GOD claimed by, to reap the fruits, a gem of life, one after next, onto knighthood and generations.
