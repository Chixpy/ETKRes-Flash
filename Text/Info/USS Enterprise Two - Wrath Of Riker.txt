It's day 2 aboard the star-ship Enterprise. Your adventure continues, so watch out for Riker and the rest of the crew.

Hints:
- The transporter public access code is on the panel, you just have to read it.
- There is a bug in the combining of weapons! Watch out!
- Check the hints to get a feel for how to play the game.
- To insert access codes in the game, remove all text and type in code.
