When nick and I (moro) were trying to come up with a theme for a collab we could lead
      together,
      we were kinda stuck. We both wanted something that could be made cohesive, something that all the parts by all
      the
      animators could have in common, without looking too similar. We puzzled together for a little while, and then
      I
      started thinking, what about a city? And that was that. Both of us LOVE textured animation, and we decided
      cardboard would be one of the more interesting substances to play with. With that, the collab was started, and
      little by little, it picked up speed, with gradually more and more people seeing the thread and trying stuff
      out,
      which was pretty cool. One of the main things we were going for was for the animators involved to stretch
      themselves, and we think that happened. - specs - 7674 frames in total, including menu, preloader game,
