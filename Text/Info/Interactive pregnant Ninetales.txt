Warning: if you don't like pregnant expansions please go back.

My last deviation - Interactive pregnant Houndoom - was very popular. I enjoyed making it and really enjoyed the fact that so many people favourited, downloaded, commented and viewed it.

So I decided to make another one of Ninetales, a beautiful Pok√©mon when it's not pregnant - and much nicer when she is. This one has a few more effects and animations than Houndoom, but I can't consider it to be real animating. And - just like before - my picture nas no shading or real details. Avoiding details and shading makes animating easier.

Well, the story is the same as before: Ninetales is peacefully sleeping in a nice grassy field until you come along and use strange forces to make her instantly pregnant. She is awakened and surprised. The controls are the same as in my last deviation (And they are explained right here in the document).

Well, that's all I have to say about it, I hope you find it equally - or more - enjoyable than the last.
