A game I made for my Spanish class called Adivina La Pelicula (Guess the Movie) where you choose a card and read the quote from a movie (which is in Spanish) and try to guess the name of the movie. You can split up into a team of two and each time one person guesses the correct movie you can add a point to the scoreboard. Use the Xâ€™s to cover up each box that a team guessed correctly. Gold boxes can be worth 5 points instead of 1. There are instructions in Spanish within this game as well for more optional rules of game play.
