Another old game from back in '07 or '08. Doesn't have many options since it was never finalized but it was fun since i don't make many animal games.

FAQ #502: Can I submit things which I made using different "games" like a doll maker or with other character generators?

My Terms of Use:
You can post screenshots of the character you create in your SCRAPS gallery only as long as you also place a link to this game in your comments. If you place screenshots of your wolf in your main gallery it is considered a form of art theft since you did not create any elements of the character yourself and will be deleted by DA admins

You may not make adoptables out of the game and use them to make any type of profit (money, points,or subscriptions) even if proper credit is given. You can however make them and give them away for free but must always credit me as the original artist and link back to this game.

EDIT:
added a preloader

Having issues getting it to play? Try these troubleshooting methods:
Update you Flash Player to the newest version [link]

Try playing it in another Internet browser. Firefox works best for me.

If its loads but doesn't play right click on the animation and select Play

Comments disable because artist comments pretty much answer every question i've received
