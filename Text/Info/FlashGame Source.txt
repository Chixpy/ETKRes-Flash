*Thanks for Frontpage, Tut collection, Daily 4th, and all the great reviews! Glad this was such a help to everyone* FlashGame Source is an interactive tutorial on the roots of game scripting by Coolio-Niato and I. We worked hard to produce a simple, clean, effective, and hopefully helpful, tutorial on flash game coding. Mini Tuts, Script Tuts and Game Engine Tuts, approx 30 tuts in total, we hope you enjoy learning from this.
