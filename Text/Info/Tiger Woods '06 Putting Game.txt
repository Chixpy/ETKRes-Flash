Original description by Dave Cole: EA wanted an interactive banner game where the user was challenged to make a putt all while Tiger Woods was intimidating them. The joke is on the user, ultimately, as it is impossible to make the putt. This banner features integrated streaming video enabled by Klipmart, as well as realistic putting physics. It was produced in a variety of standard banner sizes. Creative supplied by Freestyle.
