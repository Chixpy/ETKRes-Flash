You could go ahead and watch the video but I'd rather you read this first. After I finished this, I
      got
      kind of worried people would think I really liked math or something. I don't hate math, but I'm not
      one of
      those 'math is everywhere... fibonacci pine cones omg' people either. - While math might seem to be
      the
      focus here, the intention was to use it as a way to convey the idea of finding insight outside, and using that
      insight towards whatever it is you're doing. This is something I find very true. - All of this was done in
      two
      days before March break in order to submit it to a contest. I don't think I've ever spent a weekend
      animating so feverishly... going from working non-stop to having loads of free time felt really weird.
      Definitely
      not unappreciated though! - Im pleased that this one actually has a proper story to it, that was probably the
      biggest lurch forwards with this one... I try to get something new in every piece, and while some older stuff
      might have had a concept... or maybe a bad story, I feel good about the way this one holds together. - 156
      seconds, 24 fps, 3743 frames, woah. I THINK that might be my new record. haha. I made the music for this one
      too.
      Hope you guys like it; Its definitely a little bit different from what I usually do :] -Tucker
