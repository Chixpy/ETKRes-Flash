Today, we continue our new batch of games, actually, we have a new batch of categories, kids, because today is the day where you are going to be wonderfully surprised about the new categories that we have brought to you, such as this particular one, with the characters from the famous cartoons Over the Garden Wall. These cartoons present a wonderful story of two half brothers, Greg and Wirt, two different attitudes. The fact that Greg and Wirt are so different is the main reason they are so much fun and everybody loves them, so that no one is disturbed about this fact. Well, today, we thought it would be a great opportunity for our site games-kids.com to have these characters from Over the Garden Wall cartoons on our online gaming site, so that you kids, their numerous fans, get to play some very interesting games with them. In today's first game from Over the Garden Wall category, you kids are going to have to place together all the puzzle pieces, because this is a puzzle game, obviously, in which you are g	oing to have a lot of fun! Enjoy!
