This is a prototype of the sequal to the The Adventures of Josie True educational adventure game, which appears to have never been finished. As a result, many things are missing and/or don't work correctly.
Josie, Phil Sax, Crash, and the iCat travel to Ancient Egypt to
find Ms. Trombone and investigate Papyrus. They encounter
the famous Female Pharaoh Hatshepsut,
and solve math and science puzzles!
