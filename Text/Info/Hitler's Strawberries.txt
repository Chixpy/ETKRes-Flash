Hitler's Strawberries. A game made of pure amazing win. Conceived by the same bastards who brought you Jebediah is on Fire (blammed before its time), and Clock Day Extravagornza.

Hitler is on a quest to face his past, his future, his stomach, some other random shit, and his father...to fuel the Hindenburg II, with strawberries, so that he may fly to the ancient caverns to collect strawberries to fuel the Hindenburg II so he may fly......................
...*singularity*

If you don't like fun, Hitler, strawberries, the both combined, crazyness, a furry directing a flash game, or Hitler...then play anyway, jerk.
