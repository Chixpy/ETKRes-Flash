Very old game done as a commission back in 2008. I couldn't find an off site link to it on DressUpWho so I just decided to upload it here since i've been getting questions about it. This version of the game is a bit different from what I gave the commissioner. I replaced some of the backgrounds with ones from a dating sim game i'm working on since the original ones were pretty dated.

I tried to add all his costumes in but I don't think the series was done when I finished this game. I've been done with this game for years and have no intention of updating it.
