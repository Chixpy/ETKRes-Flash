Try to shoot the balls with similar color that are approaching linearly on the track towards the hole. Your aim is to avoid the balls reaching the hole by matching 3 consecutive balls or more of  the same color, and making them disappear to reduce the ball counts. You have got 2 power shots. One is for pausing the movement of balls for a short time and another shot can be used for reversing back. You need to be successful in all the 10 levels to win this game.
