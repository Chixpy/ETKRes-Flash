Ladies and gentlemen, After the large and phenomenal sucess of SHOCK 4: THE FINAL BATTLE! reaching over 6
      Billion hits simutaneously in a matter of a few minutes and crashing the NewGrounds server (ceasing even more hits
      overflowing the server), I decide to tear the internet a fresh new asshole by releasing another universally
      anticpated sequel to a Grammy, Emmy, Pulitzer, and 7 time Nobel Peace Prize winner: FAILED CONTAINMENT. I advise
      you to take a deep breathe, and ready yourself for the grand, epic, and groundbreaking animation of what is FAILED
      CONTAINMENT TWOOOO.
