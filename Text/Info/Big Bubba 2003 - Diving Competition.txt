"I don't know what the weather's been like around your way but it's been glorious at the
      Big
      Bubba house! So much so, that the housemates have spent most of the week in the garden, messing about in the
      pool.
      In fact, Wednesday saw the highlight of the week when the bods decided to show off their diving skills.
      Everyone
      had a bash apart from Designer Diva who didn't want to get her new bikini wet - and Old Git declined on
      account of
      his dodgy hip."
