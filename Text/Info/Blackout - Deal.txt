What would you think, if you wake up in front of an empty bottle: "Man I got so drunk last night..."? But what, if you don't have any memories, your whole salary is missing and you see a duck in front of you... well that's what they call a "sticky" situation :) Believe it, or not, this happens to some guys, so be the cool person who will help our hero find his missing money and pay his rent in 'Blackout - The Deal'. It's up to you to take all pieces of the puzzle and find out what really happened...and of course - what is next! So go on and have fun!
