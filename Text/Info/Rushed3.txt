Rushed3! Originally, the concept of Rushed was to make myself animate as much as I can for one day. That's
      what the two previous Rushed animations were, renditions of what I had made in those one days. For the third
      entry, I invited some people to suffer with me on this rite of passage. The chance to become salty men of the
      seas. There were many casualties of staying all night animating but in turn, worked out all for the best. Right
      before you is the blood, sweat, and tears of members of FluidAnims.
