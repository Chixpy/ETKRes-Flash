Edit - I think remixes are okay, so back up it goes. It's so weird to think this was my first flash movie. Ah, memories.



As ya may recall from my old pic I did fer this remix ([link]) I mentioned that I wanted ta do a flash movie to it.
It took me days of solid work with no interruptions, but I did it. I knew almost nothing about flash when I started, but I taught myself how over time. Every flash tutorial out there sucks! Why is that?
But yes. I taught myself flash and made this movie. Man, I had so much trouble with da preloader. I hope it works. There are some obvious mistakes (I bet more flash-literate peeps can spot them no prob) but it's done.
Why? Because I love this song THAT MUCH.

--Edit--

Fixed some timing errors that were driving me crazy. I couldn't fix em before since I lost Flash fer a while, but now da whole thing should be timed better.
