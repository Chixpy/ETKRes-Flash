The game opens in a resolution that may be smaller than intended.
Effects from touching the bumps on the ground could potentially be seizure-inducing.
Little dude runs and jumps. But hit those bright pads on your run, and nutty things start happening. Clones. Numbers. Upsidedownity. Each one you hit multiplies your score, so do it! DO IT! Concentrate on the running, and dig the intense music, specially crafted to motivate your lazy self.
