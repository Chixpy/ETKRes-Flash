Jambalaya is a Louisiana Creole dish of Spanish and French.Jambalaya is traditionally made in three parts, with meats and vegetables, and is completed by adding stock and rice.This colourful dish of prawns, chicken and spicy sausage looks and tastes spectacular, yet it is so easy to make. It is also a close cousin to the saffron colored paella found in Spanish culture. Delicious!
