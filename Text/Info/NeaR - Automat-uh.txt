The NeaR: Automat-uh game demo just "came" out...and it seems to be both a blessing and a curse
      to
      a certain video game convention. A parody of the game Nier:Automata! :3 Quite excited for the game tbh, just
      thought of making this lil' thingy for you guys. I was just planning to have loops on this, but suddenly
      things happened and here we are~ Well, the parody is not exactly centered around the story of the game but
      rather
      the story of a game convention. Still, I hope you guys will enjoy this one~
