A Spot-the-Difference Game based on the novel The Search for WondLa by Tony DiTerlizzi. Play through 28 different breathtaking scenes as you follow young Eva Nine's journey throughout the world of Orbona. Take your time - as you spot all of the differences in each scene, you'll unlock new scenes and your progress will be saved so you can stop and return right where you left off. Compete against your friends or play through to get the highest score possible. The game changes every time you play so this is harder then you'd think!
