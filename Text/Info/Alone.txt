This animation contains no stick figures. There is no thrilling combat action. There are no anime girls in tight clothes. You cannot dress, nor undress anyone here. You will not see any skateboards, shit jokes, or parodies of All Your Base and the Matrix. ...and I almost forgot. This movie has noting to do with clocks or the staff of NG.com.

This is for you, the viewers, to be introduced to the main character, Dr. Amichi VanDragen, before he becomes the focus of a long running series... there are some things that are going to be left unsaid... some things that you may be wondering about have already been explained in earlier reviews.
Thanks for voting everyone, and especially thanks to those who reviewed it!

**note** Older computers may have lag-it's best to watch this in low or medium quality if you have problems.
