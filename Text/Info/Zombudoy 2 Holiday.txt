Santa isn't the only one paying you a visit this Christmas! Looks like the Zombies got word of your presents, seems like Santa brought you brains for Christmas? Hmm... who knows but it's definitely something that the Zombies want. See if you can survive in this jingle hell where there's no time to compose carols but plenty to decompose zombies.
