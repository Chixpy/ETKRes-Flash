The 501th escape game from 123bee.com. Just imagine, your friend took you to a country side club house. You had great time over there and consumed lot of alcohol. Due to hangover, you went unconscious. When you awake, you realized that no one is there in the house and you got trapped inside this house. All you have to do is to escape from the house in the logical way!!!
