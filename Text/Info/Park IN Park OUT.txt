Park quickly to get the highest score you can. Select one of the cars that you would like to park in and park out. Once you select your car, your goal is to quickly park in the parking spot and also move out from the parking spot. Once you successfully park in one spot or park out, quickly drive to park in the next one. The more parking spots you can get into, the more point you get!
