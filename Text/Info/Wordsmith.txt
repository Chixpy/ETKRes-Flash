Put your noggin to the test and create as many words as you can. Creating words quickly will give you bigger points. Creating longer words and multiple words at the same time will boost your score even higher! And if at any time you get stuck, you'll always have your faithful pocket professor to egg you on (or simply rush you). This is the last of the games I made this summer. I hope you guys enjoy :)
