The asylum has been called evil since the day it opened its doors in 1865. When it was finally closed down in 1977 it had seen its fair share of evil. The patients weren't the only ones who were crazy, once someone entered the gate they would never be the same. Now it's up to you to go inside and rid the asylum of the evil that lurks inside. Good luck and have fun! *** Fixed the Leaderboard.
