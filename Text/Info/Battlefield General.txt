Released: Aug. 25, 2007 Description:It is the Qin dynasty in ancient China. The First Emperor Qin demands that all lands be pacified and be brought under his dominion. He has plans to build the Great Wall of China to protect his lands from the barbarians to the north. This is expensive business, so it is up to you to accumulate as much gold as possible in each of your war campaigns. If you accumulate less than 5000 gold pieces in any given mission, the Emperor will be displeased and will take 250 gold pieces from your war fund as a punishment for your poor service. Any gold above 5000 gold pieces will be used by the Emperor towards building the Great Wall. Show the world you are a great General, pacify the lands, make as much gold as possible, survive, and try to get on the highscore list!
