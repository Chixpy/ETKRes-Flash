Over a year later, I updated the game with some changes! Most notable is that the game should run a bit faster now, particularly in the later stages (4, 5, and Extra) The stages also no longer have to be unlocked, though you should still play them in order!

Ether has a few new maneuvers as well, pressing Spacebar will turn her attack on until you press it again, this should make things a lot easier if you're trying to play both characters by yourself. You can also now hold down X to slow her movement speed.
