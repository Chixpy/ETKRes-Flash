The 536th escape game from 123bee.com. Mr.Stafford , a famous ornithologist, came to an isolated forest for his research work. He camped near the river and started his work. Due to Heavy Flood in the Forest, his way to the town is fully damaged. He was all alone in the forest. Also it is getting late, before sunset he has to return to his town.
