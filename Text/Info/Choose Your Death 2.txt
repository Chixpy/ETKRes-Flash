Hey guys! Choose Your Death 2 is finally here, a good 2 years after I submitted the first Choose Your Death. This edition is VASTLY improved, in terms of animation, sound, and creativity in the deaths. I proudly give you what's probably my most involved work of flash to this date (though that will definitely change in the future). Sorry for the wait, but, hell, I think it's definitely worth it.

And, yes, there are a few secrets in there... ;) Good luck finding them!

Also, I have someone to give thanks to. The blood splatters found in the game are by ToXin, from FPSBANANA. Hope you don't mind I stole em!
