If you feel like it, go ahead and submit to the experimental collection. that would make me happy.
Hey everyone! People generally seemed to enjoy "the stroll", so I thought I might try my hand at some more stuff done with scanned in items. This time I was playing with different textures, like crumpled paper, lined paper, sharpee'd upon paper, newspaper, etc. This is what it ended up like. It isnt very long, about 40 seconds, so it goes by briefly, but the message I was trying to portray was that misinterpretations can sometimes be fatal towards a relationship, but that can also sometimes blossom into something really cool.
Hopefully I've been able to express that clearly enough. Enjoy!
