Vice Magazine asked me to do a game for their HORROR ISSUE. I’ve had an idea for some time to make a platform game that was really stressful, with some really insane soundtrack.

Soundtracks are so important, still most soundtracks(literally all soundtracks for games except GTA and Fallout) are complete shit. And especially when it’s supposed to be really hard and scary metal stuff, some asshole always scores some lame newmetal matrix shit.

With the help from Vice, i got the chance to make a game featuring music of three of my favourite grind bands.
The premise of the game is simple: You’re a fat guy running blindly trying to shoot your way through a neverending line of zombies. But it’s the music, and the way the game truly is based on the music in pace and feel, that makes it something else.
