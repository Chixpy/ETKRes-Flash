Here it is, the sequel to "Bothering Snape". For those who haven't seen the original, Potter Puppet Pals is a puppet show version of Harry Potter, performed by people with "Different" mental abilities, and a lot of imagination.
In this installment, Harry and friends try to stop the Dark Lord Voldemort from taking over the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Thoroughly enjoy!

PS. There's a secret bonus animation included. If you can find out how to access it, you'll get... to watch it!!
