The 80th escape game from 123bee.com  We will be releasing escape games on every Mondays and Thursdays. As you do not have the means to meet the food expenses in the cafeteria, you have been forced to hide yourself underneath the table inside the cafeteria. You will have to escape from the cafeteria by performing the needed action.  Good luck and have fun!
