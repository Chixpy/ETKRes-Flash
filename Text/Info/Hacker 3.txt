The game play is mainly text based and the sound is very minimal. You will have to do the usual things like tracking IP’s, uploading viruses and avoiding detection. You are given a simple command line program in which to hack your target. Type commands into the program and press enter to execute the command. For a list of commands needed to hack, simple enter the command ‘help’ (without the apostrophes).
