Oh no! It looks like this guy's plane ran out of power! Luckily a battery has been sent to help him, who knows where it came from? That's beside the point. See if you can help him start up the engine. All you have to do is rotate the pieces on the board so that they connect Joe's plane to the battery through 30 brain-teasing levels. Remember locked pieces cannot be removed. As you progress through the levels special elements are added to the game just for you! Play to discover what these are, you won't be disappointed!
