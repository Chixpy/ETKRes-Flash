You have to protect the flower from the swooping swarm of bees which come for its honey. Move the flower deftly using the �mouse� between the insects, avoiding contact with them. Each contact results in losing �one life�. You have a total of three lives. The longer you make this game last without contact with the bees, the more points you get.
