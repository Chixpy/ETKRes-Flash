Turn any MP3 on your hard drive into a horizontal shooter level! Use your gatling gun gyrocopter to dispose of the enemy robots. You also have homing missiles, sawblades and a shield bubble at your disposal. Louder songs will make larger monsters, and faster songs will make them move faster. Load a slow, quiet song for an easier time, but youï¿½ll upgrade slower.
