We really love horses because they are simply adorable, but owning them on your farm could turn out to be a bit messy. Your job today is to clean up three horse farms. You have a limited amount of time for each so you will have to move as fast as possible. But you can also use hints if you get stuck. In the upper part of the screen you will be able to see all your stats. Collect the corn cobs from the ground and put them all in the wheelbarrow because the horse loves eating them. The half eaten food like pieces of apples and carrots you can throw away in the trash. Stack all the hay properly and put the bell peppers in a basket. Use a small shovel to clean up the manure and fix the broken windows and furniture of the shed. In the end, groom the horse a bit too. Good luck!
