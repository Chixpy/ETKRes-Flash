15% of the total mochiads revenue generated from this game will go to a charity: either to the Peace Corps or to the US soldiers at war in the form of care packages. All musicians have been credited.

Once I put my game on newgrounds, I know other sites will steal it, list it as a hentai game, and distribute it as if they made the game. Yes they'll provide a link that offers the game for free to other sites. Come play OUR game at our site. Freak. It's my game. I've have problems in the past and my games have generated millions of views online, and it's a shame. really. *cough gamesforworks* I don't make much off my games, I just want to at least have some compensation for my hard work. Please note,  this game has also been copyrighted.

I did not look for sponsorship for this game mainly because people believe dating sims are not fun when they have no sex. I try to be different and have a few fans out there who like the innocence of a dating sim, sims which are rare, and which I am proud to say, I've created the very first original popular flash non-hentai dating sim for girls in 2006.
