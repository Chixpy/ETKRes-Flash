Break the bitter attrition of the Great War using timing, tactics and telecommunications in Morse. Step into the shoes of a Morse code operator taking the war into her own hands. Before you relayed messages, but now you're calling the shots. Literally. Send co-ordinates for artillery strikes to cut off supply chains, batter trenches and shred recon planes. Can you change the world with a push of a button?
