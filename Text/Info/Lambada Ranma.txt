Edit: I made the sound quality better.
This is the fourth ending theme to the Ranma ½ anime series. I tried to make it look as close to the actual thing as possible without stealing the actual thing or tracing images.
Ranma ½ was my favourite anime show when I made this, and Lambada Ranma (also called Rambada Ranma) was one of my favourite ending themes. You can choose whether you want Japanese lyrics, English subtitles, or no lyrics at the bottom of the screen. Enjoy!
