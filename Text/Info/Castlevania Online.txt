Update3: If you have something really important to tell me well sent me a private message in NG but if it's about the sound..I'll fix that later! lol
    
Update2: Yes I know about the sound..it's just..haa..I lost the interest after some months...I did my best you know?..anyway..probably I will complete it another day..it's just like 2 years I didn't sent a movie in NG..and..I'll tried 6 times to make the perfect conclusion of Metroid X in 2 years...so...maybe you understand me...
So...I'm terribly sorry for the sound...
