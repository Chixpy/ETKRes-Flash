Players are given colored stones they need to shift around in order to group all matching colors together (adjacent, no diagonal). Your baby brother could do that, but throw in the fact that stones are limited to a handful of moves indicated above and the game gets a lot harder. Swap two stones, and the numbers for each go down by 1. Stones with 0 are un-movable and a show stopper.
