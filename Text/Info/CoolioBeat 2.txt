Update: Much thanks for Daily Second and Frontpage <3 Also, modded the shakiness of the screen because of the unresponsiveness and lag it caused to some computers. The changes you will see once the staff check over the file =) Update: Added secondary option for controls. Now you can hold either the 12345 keys (default) or the ASDFG keys for notes. Update: Modded stat reqs. CoolioBeat 2 was supposed to come out quite a while ago, and I'm sorry for the delay, but since a promise is a promise here it is. =) Coolio Beat 2 has a different gameplay mechanic and is a tribute to Guitar Hero and Harmonix, and all the other awesome games they make. CoolioBeat 2 has 8 songs to choose from, all from the NG audio portal. All stats are saved to your computer so you can restart it later without worrying about changes to your scores. (make sure you have cookies enabled though). Enjoy it =) :NOTE: You can play the game using the SPACE bar or the BACKSPACE key for strumming, as well as use the 12345 or ASDFG keys, so you can hold your keyboard like a guitar if you REALLY feel like it. XD
