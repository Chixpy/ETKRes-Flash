Visiting the Sea Park is sure fun, unless you're poor Bubbles the Dolphin! Bubbles is a lazy dolphin but he will do anything to get some fish, like performing cool tricks. But today he wants to avoid the Sea Park ranger and just slack off for a change... Can Bubbles the Dolphin have a splashing good time, or will he become a wet fish?
