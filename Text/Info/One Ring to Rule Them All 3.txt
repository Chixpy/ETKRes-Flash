The third installment of the “One Ring” series is a little different than the others. First off you may notice the animation looks diffrent. That's because it was animated by my buddy Chris Boe, who also helps out with some of the little movies on my site.

Second is it’s not based off Lord of the Rings… almost at all. I decided to do something original with those characters. Although there's a lot of LotR jokes, so it’s just the storyline that's different.

In this episode, Wayne goes on a hot date with the lovely Red Haired Elf Chick. Will the green guy get lucky, or she realize he’s a smelly goblin? Meanwhile Sauron gets a visit from a old roommate, the Dark Lord Melkor…his former master. How will the night end for both of them? There's also some extra stuff, as well as a few easter eggs! (one is in the movie, but it goes by kinda fast)

Chris' Comments: I'd like to thank my greatest love, Coffee. Without your loving support, I would've never pulled through.
