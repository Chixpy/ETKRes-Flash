There is a dress up minigame that appears as soon as the game boots up. To bypass this, click the play button in the upper left corner.
There is a glitch where, during the bonus round, Mario will sometimes stand under the third ? block to the left while the running animation loops indefinitely, essentially softlocking the game.
The glitch will happen in some playthroughs of the bonus round but not all of them. Instances of this glitch happen at complete random.
The glitch only happened in Flashpoint Core 3. It did not happen in Core 3.1
