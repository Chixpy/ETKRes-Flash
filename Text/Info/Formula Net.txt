An internet version of the popular game in which a racing car moves along a track and you can only control its speed. Try to set new records in five different tracks. In order to increase or decrease speed, the left button of the mouse or alternatively, the arrow pointing upwards on the keyboard, must be held down. The longer that the mouse button or the arrow is depressed, acceleration will increase. A speed that is too high for the track route will cause the car to be thrown from the track.
