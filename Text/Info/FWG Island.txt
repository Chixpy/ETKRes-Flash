Rapid development and industrialisation is causing untold damage to the environment. Global warming, pollution of our waterways, and degradation of our land are symptoms of mans lust for luxuries.

You reside on a small tranquil island in the middle of the ocean. Your objective is to protect the island from the evils of development while nurturing it by planting trees.

Words are not enough to stop inappropriate development - you must take lethal action against the builders, engineers and other property tycoons to stop them from ruining your land. Chop, hack, spear, and smash the developers before they get a foothold on your land. By stopping these fiends, you are given Nature Points.

Nature Points can be used to upgrade weapons, buy trees or build other defenses on the island. Trees are required to improve the Island Health. To complete a level you need to reach the Island Health goal - which increases as the game progresses.

If you allow the developers to take a foothold, you will lose Island Health points and the environment will be damaged.
