Echogenesis is an interactive experience that throws you into a world where you can explore five unique environments. However it's important to know that Echogenesis is not a game in the traditional sense. Instead of presenting the user with a series of tasks needed to be completed in order to progress, the user is able to roam freely from environment to environment. This created the necessary setting to allow users to easily notice the various audio and visual effects caused by their interactions, which is what Echogenesis is all about.
