Extras: The printable version of the game, along with instructions for printing and playing.
ZOOMy things come in twos! Click on a tile to flip the ZOOMer. Then flip a second one to find its match ï¿½ you can only flip two at a time. If they don't match, you'll have a couple seconds to memorize them before they go back. Keep going until they're all flipped. When you're finished: the fewer rounds, the ZOOMier your score (lower is better).
