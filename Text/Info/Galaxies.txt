Galaxies, the game where you are flying in space and finding distant galaxies. Pretty simple, right? Nope, in here there are a number of enemies that will impede the search. The enemies aren’t pushovers, and this game makes them pretty hard. There are also a good number of weapons that you can get to to take them out more efficiently. The fact that you aren’t limited in the way you can buy them makes it so a player can choose the way they want to fight, whether with fast shooting lasers or powerful rockets.
