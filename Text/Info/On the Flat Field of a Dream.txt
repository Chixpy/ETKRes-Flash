No matter where, no matter when, there was a boy. He loved animals and to care for them. He always was beyond the clouds in his dreams. But once he opened up a Castaneda's book, he understood that there is no limit for a dream if you can control it. Hundreds of days were gone before boy learned at last how to understand he's in a dream. It took a lot of time, but what is time, when you can solve your problems in a dream? 'It definitely worth it, - thought boy, - now i can do whatever I want even when i'm asleep!"
