This was a film I made for the 2007 Sprockets international film festival, which had a
      smaller
      section called Jump Cuts for "Young Filmmakers" that I submitted this to. It was well recieved, and it became
      one
      of the ten finalists in the competition. Me and my class went on a field trip to see it and it was lots of
      fun.
