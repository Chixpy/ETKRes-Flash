Woot! my seventh up here! That's lucky you know. Anyways, I did this one quite a while and then didn't submit it for some reason. This one's pretty cool, its sketchy and smooth at the same time! Tis 1954 frames long, runs at 20 frames per second, and is about a minute and half. Hope you like it, and please, do review.
