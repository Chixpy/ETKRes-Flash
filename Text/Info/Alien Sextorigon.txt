"Officer Sam Log: It was a during a galactic peace conference when we first met... During the conference after dinner party is when I saw her. She was a Sextrigon Ambassador. Me ... just a low ranking space officer making sure everyone is happy. But some things I can't resist... a one night stand of hot sex one of them. And as for as alien humanoids go, she was beautiful... if you don't mind blue skin."
