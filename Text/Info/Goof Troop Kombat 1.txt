Well seems like GTK2 was well received so I bring you the not-as-good GTK 1. Still fans of the second movie may get a kick out of this. It may be important to note these movies are actually dream sequences of a whole movie I did called "A Goof's Life" which is why they start so abruptly. They are also over 4 years old.
