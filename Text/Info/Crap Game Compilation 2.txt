This is an assortment of crappy games I found on my computer. I figured since I already made one compilation like this, it wouldn't hurt to make one more with what I found. Apparently I have somewhat of a history of making crappy games, though my little joke games were actually more varied years ago than they have been recently. This compilation has the same number of games as the first, and though there is less content, there is more variety. In any case, depending on how skillful you are in the ways of connecting colors, kicking crowds of people, and evading spikes of death using the mouse, this should provide a good several minutes of entertainment, as well as show you a decent picture of what goes on in my brain.
