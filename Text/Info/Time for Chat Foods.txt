You started a small chat food shop in a city. Lots of customers started coming to your shop. Now you have to serve the customers. Give the customers their desired food, do not make them wait for long time, waiting time will be indicated, serve them before that or they will leave the shop. The number of food items will increase in the subsequent levels, and limit will also increase. Good Luck!
