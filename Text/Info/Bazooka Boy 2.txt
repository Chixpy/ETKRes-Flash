A little boy walking through crazy caves and collecting gold coins with a bazooka in his hands. The game contains many different gameplay mechanics and 17 different rocket types. Most of the levels were designed for a specific rocket type or game mechanic, so all of the levels feel fresh and the player gets curious about what is next. The game is filled with scripted events, some of which are very advanced, funny and interesting (check video for examples). Some of these events are action sequences where the play has to run from exploding TNT and falling sand and some are fancy cutscenes where the player is getting smashed through walls. Of course there are many more scripted events. Game contains over 150 different decorations, 5 music tracks and 76 sound effects. All of the levels feel very alive because of the details put to it like bats, bugs, rats and water drops that player can interact with.
