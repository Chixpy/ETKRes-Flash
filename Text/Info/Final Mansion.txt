It's been too long since I have uploaded a flash short! I have always wanted to finish this three
      part
      series and it's finally done! I have left it alone too long and now I picked it up and just finished it in
      a
      couple of months. If I can gather enough inspiration and motivation, hopefully I can keep this up! Critiques
      and
      comments are welcomed. I have been working on this short too long to know how it looks from an outside
      perspective
      anymore.
