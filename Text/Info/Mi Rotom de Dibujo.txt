Easter egg: Color enough for the Rotom to say that you've tickled him, then continue coloring and watch the mouth. Eventually, it'll disappear. Then click the green "go back to menu" arrow. Rotom will protest instead of letting you go back, and from then on, all pictures will be already colored in when you come to them, at the cost of not being able to go back to the main menu.
