Taking the concept of the Bit Crusher series and mixing in bounce physics, destructable platforms and DS-style controls, Bounce Crusher is a fun game for fans of games like Worms and Lemmings. The Bits are a race of creatures with villages built underground, and your aim is to destroy them all! Violent, original and technically advanced.
