Last Life: The Blue Key is one of the more simple and very focused point and click adventures. Of course, it should be noted that the entirety of the game is set in a single room. That should be more than laser-focused! This adventure should be new to you, and feel free to mute the music if you find it grating. controls: Select [Left-click]
