This game is a simplified recreation of one my favorite horizontal shooters, Ultimate Ecology, a Japanese arcade game for CPS-2. Boss 1: The wheel arm is most effective. The red laser does the most damage against you. Boss 2: The circle of turtles can not be destroyed, you must dodge them. Boss 3: Stay wide of this boss, it's movements are hard to predict. Boss 4: The hammer arm is most effective. Don't get frustrated.
