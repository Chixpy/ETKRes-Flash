Claustrophilia is a game about surviving in a room determined on squashing you to death. Use your running, jumping and rolling skills to dodge the never-ending effort of the blocks to hug you. Use your slowmotion powers to increase your accuracy and postpone your imminent death. You will die a lot but don't worry, revival is instant. The only punishment is that you've again failed to increase your highscore.
