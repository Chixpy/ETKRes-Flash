V1.121
Adds-
Vector arrow heads so you know the direction your gravitoids will travel!

Fixes-
Vector scaling fixed.

This is my first game. It is one part retro Pong-like, and one part particle physics. See if you can get all ranks and trophies!

When placing the gravitoids, you can hold the mouse button down and drag around the screen to give the gravitoid an initial speed and direction.

After you launch the gravitoids, you can click the screen to use a gravbomb to repel them and keep them from colliding.

The audio was created using a TIA (ATARI 2600 chip) VST called Chipsounds.
