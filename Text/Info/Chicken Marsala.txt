Chicken marsala is a Franco-Italian dish made from chicken cutlets, mushrooms, and Marsala wine. The chicken is coated in flour, briefly saut√©ed, and then removed from the pan, which is then used to make a Marsala reduction sauce. The sauce is made by reducing the wine to nearly the consistency of syrup while adding onions or shallots, as well as mushrooms, herbs and possibly other ingredients. The sauce is then poured over the chicken, which has been kept in a warming oven, and served immediately. In an alternative method, the chicken breasts braised in a mixture of Marsala, butter, olive oil, mushrooms, and spices. The dish is commonly served with pilaf, potatoes, or pasta.
