The 499th escape game from 123bee.com. On a cloudy day I planned and went to my colleague house to celebrate Thanksgiving party. When I stepped inside, the door gets locked automatically. Is this a party place or a trap place for me? Whether my friends did this or someone else? Whatever it may be I have to escape from this house. I need your help to escape, will you���.?
