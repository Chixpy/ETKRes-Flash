Please fav + comment. I will make a new one only if this one is successful. else what's the point if no one is playing?

Here it is, My Cup of Tea Romantic Dating Sim for girls FULL VERSION. Once my finger recuperates, I'm starting a new one, a longer and better one, but this only depends on the success of this game. All the music are from Flashkit.com, as freeware and linkware. Please comment and tell me how to make it better. Who do you like of all the characters? You play as silly Sara... can you unlock all the secret endings? Liger's best ending is very funny! This sim date is harmless with no hentai/ecchi/curses. And I don't get why you have to fight a character to date him/her. Also, on dates, why the heck would one ask you a million questions? Real dates are nothing like that. I've never, for one, asked my date if he remembered my breast size or waist size-- heck, I'd never tell anyone that to begin with! Down with perverted and illogical dating sims!

Have fun and enjoy! All drawn with a mouse in Flash MX, over the period of 10 days. (not straight because if that were the case, the person writing this is now a ghost-- though I must say I am very much like a zombie these days...) mwah!

On a sad note, last night, someone hacked and destroyed my website... :( nummyz.com is no more.
Very sad... that's my life, one happy note ends with an unhappy one :(
