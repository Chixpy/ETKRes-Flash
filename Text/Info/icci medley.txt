This was my entry for the FA Official Competition: Tribute to the Classics. I created a tribute to Felix
      Massie's classic icantcolourin series. It runs about 2 minutes long, and the music is by the band "OK," which is
      used in Felix's animations. - After much deliberation, I decided to submit this flash to NG since the originals
      are also hosted here; I'm sure many of you have seen them and will recognize which series I am paying tribute to.
      You can see the originals on Newgrounds: the original author's username is "FelixMassie" and the submissions were
      uploaded around the early 2000s. This is a really really late submission, sorry you guys couldn't see it earlier!
      I actually finished it a few months ago. - Felix was one of my main inspirations to pick up flash animation 5
      years ago. I can't thank him enough, and it truly warms my heart to see that Felix has become a director as well
      as a freelance animator. Felix has also made the films "Keith Reynolds can't make it tonight" and "The surprise
      demise of Francis Cooper's mother."
