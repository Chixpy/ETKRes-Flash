The 507th escape game from 123bee.com. It�s Christmas Eve. I hurried to my friend�s home along the busy snowy streets for celebration. When I entered the home with gifts, no one is there. When I tried to open the door, it has jammed. There's something scary about the air inside the room. I have to escape before something happens terribly.
