The 498th escape game from 123bee.com Hi guys an interesting game is waiting for you. Come letï¿½s play and enjoy. I and my friends planned to celebrate the Thanksgiving Day in a trip. So we booked one cottage to stay and we decided to go for a shopping to buy some items for the Thanksgiving on the next day. Unfortunately we got trapped inside the house. Friends kindly help to come out and to celebrate the day.
